# /deep-research - Universal Multi-Domain Research Command

## Purpose
Execute comprehensive research across any domain using adaptive agent orchestration to provide structured, evidence-based analysis focusing on understanding options, recommendations, and the 'why' behind choices. Produces systematic research reports with comparative analysis to enable informed decision-making across academic, technical, product, historical, literary, scientific, and practical domains.

## BEHAVIORAL EXECUTION FLOW

**CRITICAL**: This command defines how Claude executes research when the user runs `/deep-research [topic]` on Claude.

**DOMAIN LANGUAGE WARNING**: Do NOT use implementation/technical language unless the research is specifically about HOW to build/implement something technical. Product research is about WHAT to buy, not how to implement. Historical research is about WHAT happened, not how to implement. Match your language to the research domain appropriately.

### **Claude's Direct Responsibilities:**
1. **Phase 1**: Domain classification and adaptive planning with CCC framework integration
2. **Phase 2**: Multi-agent research execution with flexible wave structure
3. **Phase 3**: Comparative analysis synthesis with evidence evaluation
4. **Phase 4**: Domain-appropriate research report generation with contextually relevant recommendations

### **Agent Integration:**
- **CCC-Web-Researcher**: Primary research agent for systematic investigation
- **general-purpose**: Supporting analysis and specialized research tasks
- **Context7 integration**: Library/technical documentation when applicable
- **Component System**: Modular CCC framework components loaded as needed

## Usage
```
/deep-research [Research Topic] [--domain=auto|academic|technical|product|practical|creative] [--scope=focused|comprehensive] [--output=analysis|recommendations|comparison]
```
