# /research-plan - Systematic Research Planning & Scope Clarification Command

## Purpose
Generate comprehensive research planning documents that break down complex research queries into systematic [TOPIC-###] frameworks, providing detailed scope clarification and research proposal development to optimize subsequent `/deep-research` execution. Integrates with CCC vault architecture and follows Enhanced PRISMA systematic planning protocols.

## BEHAVIORAL EXECUTION FLOW

**CRITICAL**: This command defines how Claude executes research planning when the user runs `/research-plan [query]` on Claude.

### **Claude's Direct Responsibilities:**
1. **[PHASE-001]**: Claude analyzes user query and identifies research domains
2. **[PHASE-002]**: Claude generates [TOPIC-###] breakdown with priority classification
3. **[PHASE-003]**: Claude performs gap analysis and scope clarification
4. **[PHASE-004]**: Claude creates structured research proposal document

### **Planning Sequence:**
```
User: /research-plan [research query] [args]
  â†“
Claude: Query analysis and domain identification ([PHASE-001])
  â†“
Claude: [TOPIC-###] generation with priority matrix ([PHASE-002])
  â†“
Claude: Gap analysis and scope validation ([PHASE-003])
  â†“
Claude: Research proposal finalization ([PHASE-004])
```

## Usage
```
/research-plan [Research Query] [--priority=high|medium|comprehensive] [--depth=overview|detailed|exhaustive] [--focus=academic|technical|practical] [--integration=standalone|deep-research]
```

## Arguments
- `Research Query` - Complex research question or topic requiring systematic breakdown and planning
