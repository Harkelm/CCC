# /deep-research - Systematic Multi-Agent Research Command

## Purpose
Execute comprehensive technical research workflows using multi-agent orchestration to provide structured, actionable technical information. Focuses on delivering technical blueprints, implementation patterns, and comparative analysis to enable informed decision-making. Produces concise research reports with practical technical content and clear implementation guidance.

## BEHAVIORAL EXECUTION FLOW

**CRITICAL**: This command defines how Claude executes research when the user runs `/deep-research [topic]` on Claude.

### **Claude's Direct Responsibilities:**
1. **Phase 1**: Claude directly creates research-planning.md and directory structure
2. **Phase 2**: Claude spawns CCC-Web-Researcher agents for individual [SEARCH-###] tasks
3. **Phase 3**: Claude performs synthesis and validation of agent outputs
4. **Phase 4**: Claude generates final research report and executive summary

### **Sub-Agent Responsibilities:**
- CCC-Web-Researcher: Execute individual [SEARCH-###] search tasks as directed by Claude
- Context7 integration: Library documentation research when applicable
- **SUB-AGENTS CANNOT**: Run /deep-research command, spawn other agents, or coordinate research waves

### **EXECUTION SEQUENCE:**
```
User: /deep-research [topic] [args]
  â†“
Claude: Creates research-planning.md + directory structure (Phase 1)
