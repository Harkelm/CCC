# Product Research Planning: Apocalyptic/Disaster Preparedness Clothing & Materials
*Created: 2025-09-25 20:50:19 CST*

## Research Objective
Research and analyze clothing, materials, and essential gear products for apocalyptic/disaster preparedness scenarios, focusing on items suitable for a 6'2" male of average build. Building upon insights from previous camping equipment, survival utility equipment, and tactical clothing DIY research to identify specific purchasable products rather than DIY construction approaches.
