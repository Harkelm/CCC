# SEARCH-001: Foundation Clothing Systems - Core Garments Product Research
*Product Analysis for Apocalyptic/Disaster Preparedness Scenarios*

**Research Date**: 2025-09-25 11:45:00 CST
**Research Objective**: Systematic product research for foundation clothing systems (pants, underwear, base layers) suitable for 6'2" male in disaster preparedness scenarios
**Validation Tier**: Enhanced PRISMA (Safety-Critical Survival Products)
**Target User Profile**: 6'2" male, average build, multi-season climate adaptability requirements

---

## Executive Summary

This research identifies optimal foundation clothing products for disaster preparedness scenarios, focusing on durability, multi-climate adaptability, and extended wear under harsh conditions. Key findings prioritize tactical-grade pants, synthetic/merino wool underwear systems, and layered base layer approaches for temperature regulation across varying environmental conditions.

**Critical Finding**: Avoid cotton materials entirely for any base layer applications in survival scenarios due to moisture retention and hypothermia risk.
