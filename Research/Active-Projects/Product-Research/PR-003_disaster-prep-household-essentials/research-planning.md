**Classification**: PUBLIC | **Domain**: Product Research | **Framework**: CCC Product Research with ACS Integration

---

## ACS Component Selection

**Behavioral**: systematic-product-researcher
**Procedural**: product-research-strategy (Templates/Search-Strategies/Product-Research-Strategy.md)
**Format**: product-analysis-template (Templates/Documents/Product-Analysis-Template.md)
**Validation**: enhanced-PRISMA (safety-critical products including cleaning chemicals, pest control, medical supplies)

## Research Objective

Execute focused product research to identify the essential "little things" - household consumables, toiletries, maintenance supplies, and daily-use items - that are critical for disaster preparedness functionality but commonly overlooked in major equipment planning. Focus on WHAT to buy/choose with purchasing recommendations, cost-benefit analysis, and purchasing strategy.
