## Key Factors to Consider
- **Weather Resistance**: All fire starters must function when wet or in high humidity
- **Skill Requirements**: Balance between no-skill options (tabs) and skill-required but unlimited options (ferro rods)
- **Storage Life**: Products with indefinite shelf life reduce maintenance and replacement costs
- **Burn Duration**: Longer burn times help ignite difficult materials like wet kindling
- **Legal Compliance**: Fuel storage must meet local fire codes and quantity restrictions

## Fuel Storage Safety Requirements (2024)
- **Gasoline**: Maximum 10 gallons in attached garage, 25 gallons in detached structures
- **Propane**: Maximum 25 gallons total in portable DOT cylinders
- **Kerosene**: Store in blue approved containers, 5-year shelf life with stabilizers
- **Federal Compliance**: New ASTM standards required for portable fuel containers ≤5 gallons

## Fire Safety Integration
- **Fire Blankets**: No expiration date, effective up to 1076°F, leave no residue
- **ABC Extinguishers**: Required for Class A/B/C fires, 12-year replacement cycle
- **Sand Buckets**: Limited effectiveness, mainly for liquid fuel spill absorption
