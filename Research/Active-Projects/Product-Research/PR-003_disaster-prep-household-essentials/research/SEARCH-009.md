## Recommendations

### **Best Overall Human Waste**: Nature's Head Composting Toilet
Offers the optimal balance of capacity, reliability, and proven performance. The 4-6 week capacity for two adults and excellent odor control make it suitable for extended disaster scenarios.

### **Best Budget Waste Disposal**: Traditional Burn Barrel with Safety Modifications
At $50-100 for a basic setup, burn barrels provide immediate waste reduction, though with environmental and regulatory concerns that limit their application.

### **Best Premium Greywater**: Hydraloop H300
Despite high initial cost, the smart automation and 45% water savings justify investment for permanent installations with high water usage.

### **Best Documentation Value**: Rite in Rain Starter Kit
$50-100 provides weatherproof notebooks, pens, and basic storage for critical emergency documentation needs.
