## Domain Analysis

**Primary Domain**: Technical/Academic Hybrid
**Research Classification**: Technical architecture patterns with academic grounding in game design and AI systems

**Research Objective**:
Investigate existing patterns and practices for modular, composable agent architectures similar to Entity Component Systems from game design but applied to AI agent workflows. Identify methodologies for building "puzzle-piece" like agent systems that enable sophisticated, customizable agent behavior through modular composition.

**Scope Definition**:
- **Core Focus**: Entity Component System (ECS) patterns and their application beyond game development
- **Extended Scope**: Modular AI agent architectures, composable workflows, trait-based systems
- **Application Context**: AI assistant frameworks, agentic coding tools, modular prompt systems
- **Constraints**: Focus on existing patterns rather than novel implementations; relaxed Admiralty standards due to emerging field

**Key Research Questions**:
1. What are the core principles and patterns of Entity Component Systems?
2. How have ECS patterns been adapted to non-game domains?
3. What existing methodologies exist for modular AI agent composition?
4. What are the benefits and challenges of modular vs. monolithic agent architectures?
5. How do existing tools implement agent modularity and composability?

## Component Integration

**Templates**: Technical-Guide-Template with Research-Report-Template elements
**Validation**: Essential (10-item) validation with relaxed Admiralty standards (B3+ preferred, C2+ acceptable)
**Components Loaded**:
- CCC/Agents/Agent.md (Universal behavioral core)
- CCC/Framework/Status-Tag-Codes.md (Progress tracking)
- CCC/Framework/Admiralty-Rating-Codes.md (Source credibility - relaxed standards)
- CCC/Framework/Workflow-Core-Labels.md (Systematic organization)

**Special Considerations**:
- **Admiralty Rating Relaxation**: Given the emerging nature of ACS patterns, sources rated C2+ are acceptable with good evidence
- **Cross-Domain Research**: Will span game development, AI systems, software architecture, and workflow design
- **Pattern Focus**: Emphasis on understanding existing methodologies rather than implementation specifics

## Context Integration with Previous Research

**Building Upon**: `CCC/Research/Active-Projects/Deep-Research/agentic-coding-cli-rust-architecture/results.md`

**Key Connections**:
- Previous research identified trait-based "puzzle piece" agent composition as a core architectural pattern
- The ComposableAgent structure (AgentBehavior, AgentProcedure, AgentFormat, AgentPersonality) provides a concrete implementation example
- This research should validate and expand upon the modular approach identified in the Rust CLI research
- Focus on broader patterns and methodologies that could inform the CCC framework beyond the specific Rust implementation

**Differentiation**:
- Previous research: Implementation-focused with specific technology choices (Rust, REDB, etc.)
- Current research: Pattern-focused with methodology emphasis across domains
- Previous research: Specific to coding CLI tools
- Current research: General modular agent architecture patterns applicable to broader contexts
