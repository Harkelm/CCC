## Executive Summary

The research reveals that **modular AI agent architectures** have evolved rapidly in 2024-2025, transitioning from experimental concepts to production-ready systems. Three dominant architectural paradigms emerge:

1. **Component-Based Architecture** (ECS-inspired patterns)
2. **Event-Driven Microservices Architecture** (Distributed agent systems)
3. **Behavioral Composition Frameworks** (Dynamic trait systems)

**Key Finding**: Modern AI agent systems increasingly adopt **composition over inheritance** patterns, enabling runtime behavioral modification and dynamic capability assembly.

## Detailed Findings

### **1. Entity Component System (ECS) Patterns in AI Agents**
**Source Authority**: Software Engineering Community Documentation | **Rating**: B2
**Publication**: 2023-2024 | **Evidence Quality**: B2 - Industry-established patterns with AI adaptation

**Key Information**:
Entity Component System architecture provides a foundation for modular AI agent design through:
- **Entities**: Unique identifiers representing AI agents without inherent data or behavior
- **Components**: Data containers storing specific agent capabilities (memory, reasoning, tools)
