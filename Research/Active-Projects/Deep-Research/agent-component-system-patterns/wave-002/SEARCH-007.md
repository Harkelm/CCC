## Recommendations

### For Modular AI Agent System Design

**Hybrid Orchestration Approach**: Implement combination of central orchestration for predictable workflows and event-driven choreography for adaptive behavior, leveraging benefits of both patterns.

**Configuration-Driven Architecture**: Design systems with pluggable components and configuration-driven assembly to enable runtime composition without system redesign.

**Agent Mesh Infrastructure**: Consider implementing agent mesh patterns for enterprise-scale deployments requiring secure, governed multi-agent coordination.

**Event-Driven Foundation**: Build on event-driven architecture patterns to enable dynamic adaptation and loose coupling between agent components.

### Implementation Priorities

1. **Start with Pipeline Architecture**: Begin with modular pipeline patterns for foundational component isolation and reusability
2. **Add Event-Driven Coordination**: Layer event-driven patterns for inter-component communication and coordination
3. **Implement Service Mesh**: Introduce agent mesh patterns as system scales and requires governance/security
4. **Enable Dynamic Composition**: Develop configuration-driven assembly capabilities for runtime adaptation
