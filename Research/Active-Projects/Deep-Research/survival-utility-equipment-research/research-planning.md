# Research Planning: Survival & Hiking Utility Equipment Deep Analysis
*Created: 2025-09-25 16:45:00 CST*

## Domain Analysis
**Primary Domain**: Product Analysis (Market Research & Equipment Recommendations)
**Research Objective**: Systematic evaluation of survival/hiking utility equipment beyond basic campsite items, focusing on tools, cookware, filtration, gloves, and community-recommended tactical gadgets with nuanced pros/cons analysis
**Scope Definition**: Small utility gear excluding tents, sleeping bags, clothing; focus on field-proven reliability with "jack of all trades vs specialist" comparative analysis

## Component Integration
**Templates**: Product-Analysis-Template (from Template-Guide.md)
**Validation**: Essential (10-item) validation tier
**Components**:
- CCC/Framework/Admiralty-Rating-Codes.md (B3+ source standards)
- CCC/Framework/Comparative-Analysis-Quick-Reference.md (systematic comparison)
- Templates/Search-Strategies/Product-Research-Strategy.md (bias detection)
- CCC/Framework/Status-Tag-Codes.md (progress tracking)

## Foundation Context
**Building Upon**: Existing camping-equipment-research covering main campsite items
**Reference Source**: /camping-equipment-research/research/wave-001/SEARCH-003.md
**Established Quality Standards**: A1-A2 sources with field validation, military/tactical reliability focus
**Proven Methodology**: Professional testing organization prioritization, independent review emphasis

## Wave Structure
### [WAVE-001]: Foundation Research & Core Categories
**Objective**: Establish comprehensive understanding of utility equipment categories
**Focus Areas**:
- Survival knives (fixed blade, folding, specialty)
- Cookware systems (beyond stoves: pots, utensils, prep tools)
- Water filtration (comprehensive system analysis)
- Utility gear (cordage, repair, tools)
- Protective equipment (gloves, eye protection)
- Tactical accessories (emergency signaling, navigation aids)

### [WAVE-002]: Community Recommendations & Deep Investigation
**Objective**: Identify community-praised items not covered in mainstream reviews
**Focus Areas**:
- Reddit r/survival, r/hiking, r/bushcraft community favorites
- YouTube influencer consensus picks
- Military/tactical community recommendations
- "Hidden gem" tools with strong user advocacy
- Specialty brands not covered in mainstream media

### [WAVE-003]: Comparative Analysis & Purchase Decision Framework
**Objective**: Systematic comparison with nuanced pros/cons evaluation
**Focus Areas**:
- "Jack of all trades vs specialist" analysis framework
- Price-performance optimization across budget tiers
- Durability vs weight trade-offs
- Maintenance requirements and field serviceability
- Integration compatibility with existing gear systems

## Search Task Framework
### [WAVE-001] Foundation Tasks:
- [SEARCH-001]: Survival knife analysis and professional testing
- [SEARCH-002]: Cookware systems beyond basic stoves
- [SEARCH-003]: Comprehensive water filtration comparison
- [SEARCH-004]: Utility gear and repair equipment
- [SEARCH-005]: Protective equipment and safety gear

### [WAVE-002] Deep Investigation:
- [SEARCH-006]: Community-recommended specialty items
- [SEARCH-007]: Tactical accessories and signaling equipment
- [SEARCH-008]: "Sleeper hit" products with strong user advocacy

### [WAVE-003] Comparative Analysis:
- [SEARCH-009]: Systematic comparison matrices
- [SEARCH-010]: Purchase decision frameworks by budget/use case

## Quality Standards
**Evidence Standard**: Minimum B3 Admiralty Code, A2 preferred for safety-critical
**Source Prioritization**: Independent testing > Professional reviews > Aggregated user data > Manufacturer claims
**Bias Mitigation**: Multiple source cross-validation, marketing material skepticism
**Validation**: Essential tier with systematic comparison framework

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive coverage of utility equipment categories
- [ ] Community-recommended items identified and evaluated
- [ ] Nuanced pros/cons analysis beyond simple "best" lists
- [ ] Clear purchasing guidance across budget tiers
- [ ] Integration with existing camping gear systems
