# Domain Analysis: Geomagnetic Disaster Preparedness Equipment Research
*Created: 2025-09-25 06:45:00 CST*

## Domain Classification [CLAUDE DIRECT EXECUTION]

### **Primary Domain**: Product Domain
- **Research Focus**: Equipment and tool purchasing recommendations for electromagnetic disaster preparedness
- **Language Framework**: Product acquisition terminology (WHAT to buy, NOT how to implement)
- **Decision Type**: Purchasing decisions with cost-benefit analysis and vendor selection

### **Domain Characteristics**
- **Market Analysis**: Comparative evaluation of disaster preparedness products
- **Cost-Benefit Focus**: Price analysis with performance/reliability tradeoffs
- **Vendor Assessment**: Direct purchasing links and availability analysis
- **User Context**: Individual/family disaster preparedness buyers
- **Safety Critical**: Life-safety implications require enhanced validation

## Framework Integration [PRE-DETERMINED]

### **Template Selection**: Product-Analysis-Template
- **Structure**: Product comparison matrices with cost/benefit analysis
- **Format**: Amazon links, price analysis, distinguishing characteristics
- **Validation**: Evidence-based product recommendations with source attribution

### **Search Strategy**: Product-Research-Strategy
- **Methodology**: Independent source validation with bias detection
- **Focus**: EMP-resistant, analog, and manually-operated alternatives
- **Integration**: Extends existing disaster preparedness guide structure

### **Validation Tier**: Enhanced PRISMA (Comprehensive)
- **Rationale**: Life-safety equipment requires highest validation standards
- **Source Requirements**: A2 minimum for critical safety equipment, B3 minimum overall
- **Cross-Validation**: Multiple independent sources for product recommendations

### **Component Loading**
- **Core**: CCC/Agents/Agent.md - Universal behavioral specifications
- **Quality**: CCC/Framework/Admiralty-Rating-Codes.md - Source credibility (A2/B3 requirements)
- **Progress**: CCC/Framework/Status-Tag-Codes.md - Research completion tracking
- **Comparison**: CCC/Framework/Comparative-Analysis-Quick-Reference.md - Wave 3 synthesis

## Wave Structure Adaptation

### **Complexity Assessment**: High (12 topic areas with life-safety implications)
- **Wave Count**: 4 waves (Foundation + 2 Deep Investigation + Comparative Analysis)
- **Search Tasks**: Scalable allocation based on wave findings
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents per wave for efficiency

### **Research Boundaries**
- **Scope**: Product identification and purchasing guidance only
- **Exclusions**: Installation guides, technical implementation, system integration
- **Focus**: Equipment acquisition with electromagnetic disaster resilience validation
- **Integration**: Extends existing Products-Guide.md structure and format

## Special Requirements [USER-SPECIFIED]

### **Product List Requirements**
- **Format**: Itemized lists by category (similar to original Products-Guide.md)
- **Detail Level**: Enhanced detail about materials, construction, specifications
- **Pricing**: Current prices with direct store links (Amazon preferred)
- **Warnings**: Safety considerations, limitations, compatibility issues
- **Agent Instructions**: All agents must capture these specific details

### **Output Requirements**
1. **Standard**: results.md with comprehensive research synthesis
2. **Product Lists**: One or multiple category-based itemized lists
3. **Integration**: Compatible with existing disaster preparedness guide structure
4. **Quality**: Enhanced PRISMA validation for all product recommendations
