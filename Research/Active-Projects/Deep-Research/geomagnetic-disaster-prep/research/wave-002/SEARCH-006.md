## Research Objective

**Primary Question**: Which analog navigation tools and systems provide reliable positioning and route-finding when GPS and digital systems are unavailable during geomagnetic disasters?

**Product Focus**: Navigation equipment recommendations with manual calculation capability, accuracy without electronics, and purchasing accessibility for civilian preparedness.

---

## Executive Summary

Research identified comprehensive analog navigation solutions across five critical categories: precision compass systems, topographic mapping resources, celestial navigation tools, dead reckoning equipment, and manual surveying aids. Key findings demonstrate robust availability of professional-grade equipment with pricing ranging from $12-$200 for complete navigation capability. The 2025 World Magnetic Model update ensures current declination accuracy, critical for compass-based navigation during geomagnetic events.

**Critical Discovery**: Manufacturing quality shifts affect long-term reliability, with USA-made Brunton and Finnish Suunto maintaining higher quality standards than relocated Silva production lines.
