# SEARCH-003: EMP Protection & Faraday Cage Solutions Research

**Research Date**: 2025-09-25 14:42:00 CST
**Domain**: Product Research - Geomagnetic Disaster Preparedness
**Research Question**: What are the most effective and practical methods for protecting critical electronics from electromagnetic pulse damage?
**Validation Tier**: Enhanced PRISMA (Critical Protection Equipment)

---

## Executive Summary

Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) protection requires systematic shielding approaches using Faraday cage principles. Research identifies three primary categories: DIY construction materials, commercial Faraday bags, and whole-system protection devices. Copper mesh provides superior conductivity but at higher cost, while aluminum foil offers budget-friendly options for basic protection. Professional solutions like EMP Shield and Mission Darkness products offer military-grade protection with validated testing standards.

**Key Finding**: EMP frequencies range from 100 kHz to 1 GHz, with high-frequency energy (100s of MHz) most capable of coupling into small electronics, making 462/467 MHz testing an excellent indicator of EMP shielding effectiveness.
