- **Key Features**: No electronic components, mechanical brakes, manual transmission
- **Range**: 20-100+ miles per day depending on fitness and terrain
- **Cargo Capacity**: 20-40 lbs with basic racks

**Pricing Range**: $200-800 for quality mechanical bicycles
**Amazon Availability**: Wide selection available with 2-day shipping

#### **Cargo Bikes for Emergency Supply Transport**

**Top Recommendations Based on 2024-2025 Research**:

**Non-Electric Mechanical Options** (EMP-Resistant):
- **Yuba Mundo Cargo Bike**: Featured in disaster preparedness guides, excellent for carrying kids or cargo [B2-2]
