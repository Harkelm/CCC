*Created: 2025-09-26 01:36:00 CST*

## ACS Component Selection
**Behavioral**: systematic-researcher - Methodical investigation and analysis patterns for comprehensive framework development
**Procedural**: technical-research-strategy - Technical implementation focus with architecture analysis and pattern validation
**Format**: technical-analysis-template - Implementation-focused technical writing suitable for framework documentation and development guides
**Validation**: enhanced-PRISMA - Comprehensive validation required for foundational framework development with systematic quality assurance

## Research Objective
Construct a comprehensive, defined framework for the Agent Component System (ACS) with explicit structures, strict template schemas, XML sectioning, and innovative "Contextual TypeScript" syntax for AI-native component composition. This research will establish the foundational architecture for composable agent systems with concrete implementation patterns, directory structures, and example templates.

## Deep-Research Integration Notes
**Search Strategy**: [TOPIC-###] items will convert to systematic [SEARCH-###] tasks focusing on technical architecture patterns, implementation strategies, and validation frameworks. Research will emphasize concrete implementation patterns over theoretical analysis.
**Validation Requirements**: Enhanced PRISMA validation for all framework components with emphasis on technical feasibility, implementation consistency, and integration reliability.
**Expected Timeline**: Multi-wave research execution with foundation components (TOPIC-001 through TOPIC-003) prioritized for immediate investigation, implementation details (TOPIC-004 through TOPIC-006) in second wave, and examples/extensions (TOPIC-007 through TOPIC-009) in final wave.

## Reference Context Integration
This research builds upon the comprehensive Rust agentic CLI architecture research documented in `/home/preston/CCC/CCC/Research/Active-Projects/Deep-Research/agentic-coding-cli-rust-architecture/results.md`, particularly the trait-based component composition patterns and modular "puzzle piece" architecture. The ACS framework enhancement will adapt these proven patterns for AI-agnostic agent composition with explicit instruction syntax.

## Original Research Request

**Original User Prompt:**
"Ultrathink. I am wanting to construct a more defined framework for our @ACS.md system, with more explicitly defined structures and rules. This revolves around the creation of a new directory within CCC/ACS/ with the skeleton of our component framework. Currently, we have 7 main component types in the architecture, though only few of the examples given actually exist. For in-depth research results on what we based this on, please read this:'/home/preston/CCC/CCC/Research/Active-Projects/Deep-Research/agentic-coding-cli-rust-architecture/results.md' for further context. (CLI architecture is useful for reference but not a hard requirement in this research. This is focused on the Agent Composition Framework layer specifically.) <CCC-ACS IDEA> This is the part where things get interesting and complicated. My idea is that since we are building this for agnostic agents (or any provider), the ACS components should follow a very strict template schema with consistent sections. Additionally, I want to include short <XML></XML> div tags between major sections (llm can easily identify chunks/blocks). Then, the hard part is what I am vaguely referring to as "Contextual TypeScript", where instructions and workflow processes and any prompts/components are literally just TypeScript like blocks with context clear language. All constants and direct terminology or links must be explicitly declared, as is who does what (in the case of a workflow, specifying Claude.WriteFile('path\to\file.md') or something.) These are instructions for AI not humans, so we can build a system using our Rust example of puzzles pieces in this syntax, something like building the 'traits' (components), and then declaring a struct or 'let mut ComposableAgentName {..}' or something like that. This strictness even extends to file mentions or behaviors chaining. (ie., since components have similar sectionality, typescript style notation should be intuitive after declaring consts of the ACS paths. 'AgentFormat.Product_Template = `\path\template.md`) This is a very out of the box idea, and will require multiple avenues of research to nail down, as well as multiple tests and iterations to get just right and consistent. Please make a note within the research-proposal that the research should also contain an example bare-bones template (both REDB and .md please) and architectural tree of this ACS component tree. Also, please keep an exact copy of this full prompt in the research plan near the bottom, just for reference."
