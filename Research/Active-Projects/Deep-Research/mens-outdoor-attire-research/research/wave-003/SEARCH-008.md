**Evidence Quality**: A1 (International standards with scientific validation)

**ASTM F2732 Standard**:
- **Application**: Cold weather protective clothing temperature ratings using heated manikin testing
- **Scope**: Ensemble testing (not individual garments) for substantial body coverage
- **Activity Levels**: 2 MET and 4 MET activity level predictions
- **Limitations**: Assumes radiant temperature equals air temperature, 50% humidity, no wind effects

**EN 13537 Standard**:

### Insulation Technology Analysis

#### **Down vs Synthetic for Tactical Applications**
**Source Authority**: Military gear specialists + UF PRO tactical analysis | **Rating**: B2-2
**Publication**: 2025 tactical gear assessments | **Version**: Current technology
**Evidence Quality**: B2 (Industry experts with professional analysis)

**Synthetic Insulation Advantages**:
- **Wet Weather Performance**: Retains insulation properties when damp, critical for tactical reliability
- **Durability**: Maintains functionality without clumping, easier field maintenance
- **PrimaLoft Military Heritage**: Originally developed for US military requiring all-weather performance
- **Operational Reliability**: Performs when needed most, continues functioning when down fails

**Down Insulation Limitations**:
- **Moisture Vulnerability**: Clumps and loses loft when wet, slow to dry in field conditions
- **Deployment Issues**: Requires time to re-loft after compression, problematic for mission-critical gear
- **Maintenance Requirements**: Requires proper care to prevent clumping and functionality degradation

**Tactical Recommendation**: Synthetic insulation preferred for military/tactical applications due to reliability in unpredictable conditions and superior wet-weather performance.
