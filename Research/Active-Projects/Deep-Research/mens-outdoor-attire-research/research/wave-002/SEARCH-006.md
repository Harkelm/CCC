1. **Merino wool base layers** (Smartwool Merino 250) for **general multi-climate use** and **extended wear scenarios**
2. **Synthetic base layers** (Patagonia Capilene Thermal Weight) for **high-output activities** and **rapid moisture management priority**

**Rationale**: No single material optimizes all performance criteria across the specified -60°F to +70°F range with varying activity levels.

### **Tactical Shirt Selection**

**Primary Recommendation**: **Professional polo-style tactical shirts** from established manufacturers based on budget tier:
- **Budget-conscious**: TRU-SPEC 24-7 Series for basic tactical functionality with professional appearance
- **Balanced performance**: 5.11 Tactical Performance Polo for proven durability and professional standards
- **Premium performance**: Vertx systems for maximum durability and advanced moisture management

**Style Recommendation**: **Button/polo style preferred** over pullover for professional appearance flexibility and temperature regulation capability.

### **Layering Integration Strategy**

**Professional Appearance Protocol**:
1. **V-neck base layer** integration for button-style tactical shirts
2. **Color coordination** between base layer and tactical shirt for professional appearance
3. **Bulk management** through appropriate base layer weight selection based on expected activity level

**Performance Optimization**:
- **Activity-specific selection**: Match base layer material (wool vs synthetic) to expected activity intensity
- **Climate adaptation**: Layer weight selection based on temperature range within -60°F to +70°F spectrum
- **Professional standards**: Maintain tactical shirt professional appearance across all layering combinations
