## Body Type Accommodation Framework

### Athletic Build Adaptations

#### Characteristics and Challenges
**Athletic Body Type Features [B3]:**
- Well-developed muscles with straight silhouette and minimal curves
- Wider shoulders with proportionally smaller waist
- Muscular thighs and seat requiring additional room
- Standard clothing often too tight in chest/shoulders, too loose in waist

**Tactical-Specific Solutions [B2]:**
```yaml
athletic_modifications:
  chest_accommodation: "Size for chest/shoulder dimensions, taper waist"
  sleeve_design: "Athletic cut with stretch panels for movement"
  trouser_fit: "Athletic fit through thighs with tapered legs"
  fabric_selection: "Minimum 1% lycra/stretch for comfort and mobility"
```

#### Implementation Protocol
1. **Size Selection**: Always fit broadest part first (shoulders/chest), then alter other areas
2. **Fabric Choice**: Denim/fabric with minimum 1% lycra for stretch accommodation
3. **Cut Modifications**: Bootcut or slightly flared pants to balance thicker thighs
4. **Construction**: Use stretch stitching techniques for high-stress areas

### Slim Build Recommendations

#### Fitting Strategy [B3]
**Optimal Approaches:**
- Showcase athletic shape with slim and fitted clothes
- Size appropriately to hint at fitness without excessive tightness
- Focus on clean lines and proper proportions
- Avoid excess fabric that creates bulk

## Pattern Grading and Family Sizing

### Pattern Grading Fundamentals [B3]

#### Grading Methodology
**Four Basic Methods:**
1. **Slash and Spread**: Manual pattern expansion for home use
2. **Shift Method**: Proportional adjustments for size variations
3. **Nested Patterns**: Evenly graded pattern development
4. **Computer Grading**: Digital scaling (advanced applications)

**Home Sewing Applications:**
- Manual pattern grading suitable for home sewing and small-scale production
- Base pattern development from middle-size sample
- Proportional scaling up and down from established base

#### Family Size Implementation
```yaml
family_sizing_system:
  base_pattern: "Develop middle-size pattern as reference"
  size_ranges:
    - "Adult range: Sizes 6-18 (A-G range)"
    - "Extended range: Sizes 14-26 (E-K range)"
    - "Youth adaptations: Proportional scaling with growth accommodation"

  scaling_factors:
    - "Chest/bust: 2-inch increments between sizes"
    - "Waist: 1.5-inch increments for proper fit graduation"
    - "Hip: 2-inch increments maintaining proportion"
    - "Length adjustments: 0.5-inch increments for height accommodation"
```

### Modular Design Integration

**ModularME Approach:**
- Single base pattern with 17 functional modules
- Almost endless variety from standardized components
- Two size ranges covering comprehensive fit requirements
- Adaptable for tactical applications with modification

**Tactical Modular Applications:**
```yaml
modular_tactical_system:
  base_garment: "Core tactical shirt/jacket pattern"
  functional_modules:
    - "Equipment attachment panels"
    - "Ventilation systems"
    - "Pocket configurations"
    - "Reinforcement panels"
    - "Weather protection modules"
```
