### 5.2 Modification Rights [B2-2]

#### Personal Use Modifications
- **Legal Standing**: Pattern creators "lack legal standing" to restrict post-purchase use
- **Copyright Limitations**: Owners only have rights "defined under copyright law"
- **First Sale Doctrine**: Purchasers generally free to modify for personal use
- **Contract Law**: Terms of service may create separate contractual obligations

#### Commercial Considerations
- **Licensing Options**: Some designers offer commercial licenses
- **Angel Licenses**: One-year production licenses available from some creators
- **Safe Approach**: Use clearly open-source patterns or create original designs for commercial use

### 5.3 Open Source Pattern Licensing [A1-1]
