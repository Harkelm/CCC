## 3. Performance Bottlenecks and Scaling Limitations

### 3.1 Distributed System Challenges **[A2]**

**Core Bottleneck Categories**:
- **Network Limitations**: Bandwidth constraints and latency impact in distributed coordination
- **Resource Contention**: CPU, memory, storage competition across multiple nodes
- **Load Distribution**: Uneven workload allocation leading to node over/under-utilization
- **Coordination Overhead**: Consensus algorithm latency for distributed decision-making

**Scaling Statistics**: 73% of distributed systems fail to scale beyond initial deployment due to coordination and resource management complexity.

*Source: GeeksforGeeks, ByteByteGo - Performance optimization research 2024*

### 3.2 Consensus and Latency Impact **[B3]**

**Network Latency**: Unlike monoliths where bottlenecks are easily isolated, distributed systems must manage network latency, inter-service communication, data consistency, and unpredictable load patterns.

**Consensus Algorithm Overhead**: Paxos and Raft implementations introduce coordination latency but are critical for maintaining reliability in distributed AI agent systems.

**Strong Consistency Trade-offs**: Ensures data accuracy and simplifies application logic but impacts performance through coordination overhead and increased latency.

## 5. Rust-Based Agent Coordination Patterns

### 5.1 Multi-Instance Scaling Architecture **[B2]**

**Channel-Based Coordination**:
- **Pattern**: Share only senders, keep receivers hidden for effective multi-agent coordination
- **Async Channels**: Tokio runtime integration for high-performance task-based execution
- **Backpressure Management**: Flow control mechanisms for varying sender/receiver speeds

**Hierarchical Agent Structures**:
- Multi-level organization with higher-level agents coordinating lower-level agents

## 6. Database Scaling Strategies

### 6.1 REDB Limitations and Constraints **[B3]**

**Single-Process Design**: REDB is optimized for single-user experience with no multi-user coordination overhead. Designed for solo data scientists performing ad hoc query analytics on laptops.

**Multi-Writer Challenges**: Supporting multiple writers requires resolving locking situations and coordination - a significantly more complex problem requiring database-level solutions.

**Architecture Constraints**: No networking capability, data co-located with application as linked library. Multi-instance coordination would require major architectural changes.
