# Research Planning: Hybrid Symbolic-Neural AI Architecture
*Created: 2025-09-27 14:32:00 CST*

## Domain Analysis
**Primary Domain**: Technical (Implementation-focused architecture research)
**Research Objective**: Evaluate feasibility and implementation strategies for hybrid AI systems combining Rust algorithmic intelligence (agent.rs) with semantic/linguistic capabilities through local vector databases
**Scope Definition**: Technical architecture analysis, implementation patterns, performance characteristics, and deployment strategies for locally-operated hybrid AI systems

## Component Integration
**Templates**: Technical-Guide-Template (implementation guidance)
**Validation**: Essential (10-item) validation for technical accuracy
**Components**:
- CCC/Framework/Admiralty-Rating-Codes.md (B3+ minimum for technical sources)
- Technical implementation focus with comparative analysis framework
- Performance benchmarking and trade-off evaluation

## Research Context & Reference Materials
**Foundation Research**: Building on existing ACS framework evolution toward agent.rs implementation
**Reference Files**:
- `reference/ACS.md` - Agent Component System framework
- `reference/ACS-Framework-Enhancement-Research-Report.md` - Rust-TypeScript hybrid architecture
- `reference/comprehensive-foundation-strengthening-synthesis.md` - Multi-agent coordination patterns
