## Research Objective & Context

### **Primary Research Goal**
Identify and validate advanced multi-agent coordination patterns that extend the existing REDB + candle + ratatui architecture foundation to enable reliable, efficient, and conflict-free multi-agent operations for agentic coding CLI systems.

### **Existing Foundation Assessment**
Based on comprehensive analysis of `results.md` and `CCC-Workflow-Example.md`, we have:

#### **‚úÖ Established Architecture Strengths**

- **Agent Composition Framework**: Trait-based modular system (Behavior/Procedure/Format/Personality)
- **Provider Abstraction**: Local/remote switching with circuit breaker patterns
- **CLI/TUI Integration**: Advanced ratatui interface with tmux + LazyVim workflow
- **Security Framework**: Multi-layer isolation (WebAssembly + Bubblewrap + Landlock)
- **Individual Agent Resilience**: Complete interruption recovery and incremental logging

#### **‚ùå Critical Coordination Gaps**
- **Multi-Agent Deadlock Prevention**: No coordination protocols for concurrent agents
- **Context Window Management**: No strategies for managing large multi-agent research contexts
- **Agent Trust & Validation**: No verification frameworks for multi-agent outputs
- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: No intelligent task distribution patterns
- **Conflict Resolution**: No systematic approaches for contradictory agent findings
- **Cross-Agent Memory**: No shared knowledge management across distributed agents
- **Observability**: No debugging/monitoring patterns for multi-agent system behavior

### **Research Scope Definition**
**Domain**: Technical Implementation (system architecture and coordination patterns)
**Focus**: HOW to implement reliable coordination, not WHAT tools to use
**Validation Standard**: Essential (10-item) tier with B3+ sources minimum, A2+ preferred
**Implementation Context**: Rust-based architecture extending existing REDB foundation
