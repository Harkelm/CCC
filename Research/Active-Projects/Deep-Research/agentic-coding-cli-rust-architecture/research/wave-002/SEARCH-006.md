### Context Window Optimization with Sliding Window Attention

**Source Authority**: Papers With Code + Mistral AI Research | **Rating**: A2
**Publication**: 2024 | **Version**: Current research
**Evidence Quality**: A2 (Peer-reviewed research with practical validation)

**Key Information**:
- Sliding Window Attention (SWA) restricts each token to attend only to neighboring tokens within a fixed-size window, reducing computational complexity from O(n²) to O(n)
- **Memory Benefits**: Ensures linear computational complexity and constant KV cache consumption, regardless of sequence length
- **Implementation**: Most effective with window sizes between 512-4096 tokens depending on task complexity
- **Performance Trade-off**: Larger windows maintain performance similar to full attention but offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios

**Reliability Assessment**:
