- `semantic/{topic}/{priority}` for semantic memory organization
- `episodic/{session_id}/{sequence}` for episodic event tracking
- `workflow/{project_id}/{phase}/{checkpoint}` for workflow state persistence

**Performance Optimization**:
- Leverage REDB's B-tree structure for efficient range queries on context levels
- Use MVCC for concurrent read access during inference operations
- Implement copy-on-write semantics for context versioning and rollback capabilities

## Research Gaps & Limitations

- **Limited Production Evidence**: While academic research shows promising results, real-world performance data for large-scale context management systems remains limited
- **Integration Complexity**: Specific implementation details for REDB-candle integration require further investigation and prototyping
- **Performance Trade-offs**: Optimal balance between compression ratios and information loss needs empirical validation for specific use cases
- **Memory Hierarchy Optimization**: Advanced memory management strategies require more research into optimal hierarchical structures for different workflow types

## Recommendations

1. **Implement Layered Architecture**: Begin with basic semantic/episodic memory separation using REDB's hierarchical key structure
2. **Prototype Compression Pipeline**: Start with ICAE-based compression for 4x reduction before exploring higher compression ratios
3. **Develop Priority Scoring System**: Implement weighted scoring combining recency, relevance, and importance factors
4. **Create Context Restoration Framework**: Build session continuity management with REDB persistence and candle inference integration
5. **Validate Performance Metrics**: Establish benchmarks for context compression ratios, retrieval latency, and inference quality preservation
