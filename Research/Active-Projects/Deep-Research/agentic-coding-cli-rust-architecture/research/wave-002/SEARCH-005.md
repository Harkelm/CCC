- **Performance Isolation**: Memory access patterns don't interfere with core agent functionality

## Research Gaps & Limitations

**Identified Gaps**:
1. **Real-World Scaling**: Limited empirical data on systems with >100 concurrent agents
2. **Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer**: Insufficient research on knowledge sharing across different problem domains
3. **Privacy Preservation**: Limited frameworks for selective knowledge sharing with privacy constraints
4. **Performance Degradation**: Insufficient analysis of memory system performance under high conflict scenarios

**Research Limitations**:
- Most practical implementations are early-stage (2024-2025) with limited long-term validation
- REDB integration patterns are largely theoretical with limited production evidence
- Conflict resolution mechanisms primarily validated in controlled environments

## Recommendations

**Implementation Priorities**:
1. **Start with Hierarchical Memory**: Implement multi-tier storage using REDB as persistence layer
2. **Establish Conflict Resolution**: Deploy consensus mechanisms before scaling agent populations
3. **Implement Experience Sharing**: Begin with successful workflow pattern sharing between similar agents
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track memory access patterns and optimize hot paths

**Architecture Decisions**:
- **Choose REDB for Embedded Scenarios**: Leverage memory safety and small footprint for distributed deployments
- **Implement Hybrid Search**: Combine semantic, keyword, and graph traversal for optimal retrieval
- **Design for Conflict**: Plan consensus mechanisms from system inception rather than retrofit
- **Prioritize Type Safety**: Leverage REDB's type safety for reliable shared data structures

**Risk Mitigation**:
- **Gradual Scaling**: Start with limited agent populations to validate memory sharing patterns
- **Monitoring Integration**: Implement comprehensive memory access and conflict resolution monitoring
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Design graceful degradation when consensus mechanisms fail
- **Privacy Controls**: Implement fine-grained access controls for sensitive knowledge sharing
