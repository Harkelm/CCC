*Created: 2025-09-26 01:25:00 CST*

**Classification**: PUBLIC | **Domain**: Practical/Technical | **Framework**: CCC Deep-Research

---

## Domain Analysis

**Primary Domain**: Practical (How to make/construct clothing)
**Secondary Domain**: Technical (Material science and construction techniques)
**Research Objective**: Create comprehensive fabrication blueprints and sewing patterns for disaster-resistant clothing with defensive capabilities, focusing on DIY construction rather than product acquisition
**Scope Definition**: Clothing construction patterns, material specifications, and fabrication techniques for apocalyptic/disaster preparedness scenarios

## Research Context Integration

**Previous Research Foundation**:
- `/Research/Active-Projects/Product-Research/PR-001_apocalyptic-clothing-materials/results.md` - Product focus, needs conversion to DIY fabrication
- `/Research/Active-Projects/Product-Research/PR-001_apocalyptic-clothing-materials/research/SEARCH-005.md` - Advanced materials analysis for integration
- `/Research/Active-Projects/Deep-Research/geomagnetic-disaster-prep/results.md` - Environmental considerations for material selection

**Research Transformation**: Converting product-focused findings to construction-focused blueprints with specific fabrication instructions

## Component Integration

**Templates**: Technical-Guide-Template (selected for HOW to construct focus)
**Validation**: Essential tier + Safety protocols (protective gear considerations)
**Components**:
- CCC/Agents/Agent.md (core behavioral specifications)
- CCC/Framework/Status-Tag-Codes.md (progress tracking)
- CCC/Framework/Admiralty-Rating-Codes.md (source credibility, B3+ minimum)
- CCC/Framework/Workflow-Core-Labels.md (systematic organization)

## Target Fabrication Items

**Required Clothing Categories**:
1. **[PANT-DIY]** Pants - warm weather + cold weather versions
2. **[UNDER-DIY]** Basic undershirt construction
3. **[TOP-DIY]** Main protective top (multi-layer/material, heavy outdoors + law enforcement grade)
4. **[OUTER-DIY]** Experimental meta-material PCM outer layer (windbreaker/raincoat style with defensive capabilities)

**Additional Research Requirements**:
- Disaster cycle weather considerations from geomagnetic research
- Defensive protection techniques within civilian legal limits
- Patent research for technique inspiration (not direct use)
- Material accessibility for civilian fabrication

## Wave Structure

### [WAVE-001]: Foundation Fabrication Research
**Objective**: Establish sewing patterns, basic construction techniques, and material fundamentals
**Search Tasks**: [SEARCH-001] through [SEARCH-004]
- [SEARCH-001]: Basic clothing construction patterns and techniques
- [SEARCH-002]: Material specification and sourcing for civilian fabrication
- [SEARCH-003]: Disaster-resistant clothing design principles
- [SEARCH-004]: Basic protective clothing construction methods

### [WAVE-002]: Advanced Materials & Protection Research
**Objective**: Meta-material applications, defensive techniques, and patent analysis
**Search Tasks**: [SEARCH-005] through [SEARCH-008]
- [SEARCH-005]: Meta-material and PCM integration techniques for DIY fabrication
- [SEARCH-006]: Defensive clothing techniques and patent analysis (civilian legal limits)
- [SEARCH-007]: Disaster cycle environmental adaptation for clothing design
- [SEARCH-008]: Advanced sewing and construction techniques for protective gear

### [WAVE-003]: Comparative Analysis & Blueprint Development
**Objective**: Systematic comparison of techniques with final fabrication blueprints
**Search Tasks**: [SEARCH-009] through [SEARCH-010]
- [SEARCH-009]: Comparative analysis of construction methods and materials
- [SEARCH-010]: Integration testing and final blueprint optimization

## Research Execution Standards

**Evidence Requirements**: B3+ minimum source rating, A2+ for safety-critical protective techniques
**Documentation Focus**: Direct links to patterns, construction guides, and material specifications
**Language Protocol**: Technical construction language appropriate since research is about HOW to make clothing
**Output Requirements**: Structured fabrication blueprints with dimensions, materials, and step-by-step instructions

## Agent Deployment Framework

**Primary Agent**: CCC-Web-Researcher with technical construction methodology
**Search Strategy**: Technical-Research-Strategy focused on fabrication instructions and material specifications
**Critical Instructions for Agents**:
- Focus on HOW TO MAKE clothing, not what to buy
- Provide direct links to patterns and construction guides
- Include specific dimensions and material characteristics
- Document patent findings for technique inspiration (not direct copying)
- Consider legal civilian limits for defensive capabilities

## Success Criteria

**Completion Validation**:
- [ ] Complete sewing patterns with dimensions for all 4 clothing categories
- [ ] Material specifications with civilian accessibility considerations
- [ ] Step-by-step construction instructions with why/what explanations
- [ ] Defensive technique integration within legal limits
- [ ] Disaster cycle environmental adaptations incorporated
- [ ] Patent analysis for technique inspiration documented
- [ ] Comparative analysis with clear recommendations

**Quality Standards**:
- All sources meet B3+ Admiralty rating minimum
- Technical accuracy verified through multiple independent sources
- Safety warnings included for all construction techniques
- Legal compliance verified for all defensive applications
