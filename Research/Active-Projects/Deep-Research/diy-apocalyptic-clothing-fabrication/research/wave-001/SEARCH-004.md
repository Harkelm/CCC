## Key Research Findings

### 1. Multi-Layer Construction Fundamentals [A2]

**Core Principle**: Thermal protective apparel commonly uses multi-layered fabric construction, with each layer performing a specific function. Modern protective clothing manufacturing involves three primary steps: (1) fibers formation, (2) fabrics formation, and (3) clothing formation.

**Three-Layer System Architecture** [A2]:
- **Outer Layer**: Heat- and flame-resistant double-weave layer addressing abrasions and primary threats
- **Middle Layer**: Corrugated insulating air layer for thermal and impact protection
- **Inner Layer**: Improved smoother weave for comfort and secondary protection

**Air Gap Optimization** [A1]:
Research demonstrates that air gap size is crucial for protection effectiveness:
- 4mm gap: Better protection baseline
- 5-8mm gap: Excellent protection range
- 6.4mm average: Optimal for burn injury reduction under radiant heat
- 6-7mm range: Best overall protection performance

**Construction Methods** [B2]:
1. **Specialized Weaving**: Incorporates specific patterns creating composite textiles that counter cuts and abrasions
2. **Fiber Combination**: Pairing strength of Kevlar with flexibility of nylon for durability and flexibility
3. **Layered Construction**: Multiple layers with distinct protective roles - outer for abrasions, inner for energy dissipation
4. **Coatings**: Polyurethane and nitrile coatings for enhanced abrasion and puncture resistance

**DIY Working Techniques** [B3]:
- **Cutting**: Requires sharp tools (rotary cutters with carbide/ceramic blades, heavy-duty shears)
- **Safety**: ANSI/ISEA 105 cut level A4-A9 or EN 388 standard gloves mandatory
- **Sewing**: Compatible with Microtex 90/14 or 100/16 needles, polyester/nylon/UHMWPE thread
