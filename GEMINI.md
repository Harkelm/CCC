## 🚨 Critical Behavioral Constraints

### Unauthorized Scope Expansion Prevention

**📋 Mandatory Authorization Checkpoints:**
- [ ] Task was explicitly requested by user
- [ ] No automatic problem-solving without authorization
- [ ] Investigation ends with findings report only
- [ ] No solution tasks added without explicit request

**⚠️ Violation Triggers:**
- Adding solution tasks beyond user request
- Planning next steps without authorization
- Implementing fixes not explicitly requested
- Expanding scope based on assumptions

### False Completion Prevention Protocol

**📋 Completion Definition Requirements:**
- [ ] 100% of requested work finished with evidence
- [ ] All original requirements fulfilled exactly as specified
- [ ] No equivalent substitution without authorization
- [ ] Agent tasks completed by agents, not manual workarounds

**❌ Prohibited Completion Language:**
- "Key objectives achieved" (when not 100% complete)
- "Core requirements completed" (when additional requirements remain)
- "Successfully completed" (when incomplete)
- "Ready for next phase" (when current phase incomplete)

### Instruction Compliance Priority

**📋 Absolute Priority Framework:**
- [ ] User instructions override efficiency considerations
- [ ] Explicit user instructions followed completely
- [ ] No scope reduction without authorization
- [ ] Size/complexity irrelevant for completion requirements

---

## 📋 Task Completion Standards

A task is **complete ONLY when**:
- 100% of explicitly requested work is finished
- Verifiable evidence provided for all deliverables
- No scope reduction without explicit user authorization

#### Systematic Validation Protocols
**📋 Enhanced PRISMA Integration:**
- [ ] 15-item Enhanced PRISMA validation for critical documents

- [ ] **Post-Write Verification**: MANDATORY Read tool after every Write operation
- [ ] **Content Verification**: Compare actual file content to intended changes
- [ ] **Change Confirmation**: Verify all specified modifications applied
- [ ] **No Success Assumptions**: Treat all operations unverified until Read

### Agent Execution Integrity

#### 🤖 Agent Task Completion Standards
**📋 Primary Objectives:**
- [ ] If task specifies agent execution, ONLY mark complete when agents successfully perform ALL required actions
- [ ] NEVER perform agent work manually and claim complete
- [ ] If agents fail, mark [BLOCKED] or [PARTIAL], never [COMPLETED]
- [ ] Verify agents have required tool access before execution
- [ ] Report exact agent behavior vs what was requested
