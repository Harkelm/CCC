# Context Command Center (CCC) Research Framework

Welcome to the Context Command Center (CCC), a systematic framework for conducting evidence-based technical research using AI agents. This project utilizes a structured directory of markdown files to produce high-quality, actionable technical blueprints and analyses.

While the architecture has references to Obsidian vaults, it is designed to be a self-contained system of markdown files and does not require Obsidian to use. The core of the framework is a two-command workflow that ensures consistent, accurate, and comprehensive results. The `Home.md` and `Vault-Guide.md` are simply examples on how this research may be directly integrated with an already existing reference file archive.

## Core Workflow

The research process is primarily driven by two commands: `/research-plan` and `/deep-research`. This two-step pattern ensures that a well-defined, systematic plan is in place before execution, leading to more accurate and relevant outcomes.

### Step 1: Planning with `/research-plan`

The workflow begins with a complex research query. The `/research-plan` command is used to analyze this query and generate a comprehensive, structured research proposal by breaking down the topic into systematic `[TOPIC-###]` frameworks.

-   **Purpose**: To deconstruct a broad topic into a series of specific, measurable, and prioritized investigation areas (`[TOPIC-###]`) with systematic scope clarification.
-   **Output**: A comprehensive `research-proposal.md` file that defines the scope, objectives, quality standards, and detailed breakdown of research topics organized by priority (High, Medium, Low priority topic classifications).
-   **Command Source**: Built from `.claude/commands/research-plan.md`
-   **Example**: See the plan for our case study: [`/Research/Active-Projects/Deep-Research/agentic-coding-cli-rust-architecture/research-proposal.md`](/Research/Active-Projects/Deep-Research/agentic-coding-cli-rust-architecture/research-proposal.md)

### Step 2: Execution with `/deep-research`

Once the proposal is finalized, the `/deep-research` command executes the plan. It systematically works through the defined `[TOPIC-###]` areas using a multi-wave approach to gather, synthesize, and validate information through specialized search tasks.

-   **Process**:
    1.  Creates a dedicated directory structure for the research project.
    2.  Executes research in systematic "waves" (`WAVE-001`, `WAVE-002`, `WAVE-003`), where each wave consists of three discrete search tasks (`SEARCH-001`, `SEARCH-002`, etc.) with specific focuses:
        - **WAVE-001 (Foundation Research)**: Academic papers, technical documentation, community insights
        - **WAVE-002 (Deep Dive Investigation)**: Gap-focused research, implementation analysis, expert perspectives
        - **WAVE-003 (Technical Comparison & Implementation)**: Comparative analysis, implementation patterns, expert insights
    3.  Synthesizes the findings from each wave into a `wave-synthesis.md` file.
    4.  Generates the final, comprehensive technical report (`results.md`) and a high-level `executive-summary.md`.
-   **Command Source**: Built from `.claude/commands/deep-research.md`
-   **Example**: See the final report for our case study: [`/Research/Active-Projects/Deep-Research/agentic-coding-cli-rust-architecture/results.md`](/Research/Active-Projects/Deep-Research/agentic-coding-cli-rust-architecture/results.md)

#### Execution Models: Gemini vs. Claude

-   **Gemini (Single-Agent Model)**: The Gemini version of the command operates as a single, highly-capable agent. It personally handles all phases of the research, from planning and wave execution to the final synthesis and report generation.

-   **Claude (Multi-Agent Orchestration)**: The Claude version acts as an orchestrator. It spawns specialized, subordinate `CCC-Web-Researcher` agents to perform the individual `[SEARCH-###]` tasks in parallel or sequentially. Claude then synthesizes the findings returned by these agents before proceeding to the next wave or generating the final report.

Despite these internal differences, both models follow the same structured process to produce the same set of high-quality, standardized output files.

## Example Project: Agentic Coding CLI in Rust

The directory [`/Research/Active-Projects/Deep-Research/agentic-coding-cli-rust-architecture/`](/Research/Active-Projects/Deep-Research/agentic-coding-cli-rust-architecture/) serves as a complete case study of the CCC framework in action.

### Key Artifacts

In addition to the `research-proposal.md` and `results.md` generated by the core workflow, this project includes supporting artifacts that demonstrate the framework's utility:

-   **`CCC-Workflow-Example.md`**: A practical, real-world code example that demonstrates how to *apply* the findings from the research. It provides a tangible implementation of the architectural blueprint detailed in the `results.md` file.

-   **`workflow-feedback.md`**: An AI-generated self-assessment of the `/deep-research` process itself. This file offers unique insights into the workflow's performance and limitations. In this case study, it documents a critical meta-learning: an agent interruption due to token limits provided real-world validation for the very architecture being researched, proving the necessity of workflow persistence.

## Deep-Research Directory Structure

The `/deep-research` command creates a systematic directory structure for organizing research findings. Here's the actual directory tree generated for our case study project:

### Key Structure Elements

- **Root Level**: Contains the final deliverables and supporting artifacts
- **research-proposal.md**: Comprehensive research plan generated by the `/research-plan` command, containing systematic `[TOPIC-###]` breakdown organized by priority
- **research/** subdirectory: Houses the systematic wave-based research execution with three specialized waves:
  - **Foundation Research (wave-001)**: Academic sources, technical docs, community insights
  - **Deep Dive Investigation (wave-002)**: Gap analysis, implementation focus, expert perspectives
  - **Technical Comparison (wave-003)**: Alternative approaches, implementation patterns, expert insights
- **SEARCH-###.md** files: Individual search tasks with specific research focuses and validation requirements
- **wave-synthesis.md** files: Synthesized findings from each research wave with quality metrics
- **results.md**: The comprehensive final technical report combining all research with actionable implementation guidance

This structure enables systematic research execution, clear organization of findings, and traceable evidence chains from individual searches through wave synthesis to final conclusions.

## How to Use the Framework

To experiment with the CCC research framework:

1.  **Plan Your Research**: Use the `/research-plan` command with a detailed prompt for your topic.
    -   Example: `/research-plan "Optimal architecture for a real-time data processing pipeline in Go"`
2.  **Execute the Research**: The `/deep-research` command will automatically use the generated `research-proposal.md` to begin its systematic, multi-wave investigation.
3.  **Review the Results**: Once complete, review the `results.md`, `executive-summary.md`, and other generated artifacts in the project's directory.

The framework is designed to be a powerful tool for anyone looking to conduct deep, structured, and reliable technical research with the assistance of AI.
