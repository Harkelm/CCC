- **API Design**: Zero-copy, thread-safe, BTreeMap-like interface
- **Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies, self-contained implementation

---

## ACID Properties Implementation

### Atomicity Implementation
REDB ensures atomicity through its transaction management system where all operations within a transaction either complete entirely or are rolled back completely.

**Key Features:**
- **Transaction Boundaries**: Clear begin/commit/rollback semantics with automatic cleanup
- **Crash Recovery**: Automatic detection and recovery from crashes, power loss, and unclean shutdowns
- **Savepoints**: Support for nested transaction-like behavior with rollback to specific points
- **Integrity Checking**: Comprehensive checksumming using XXH3_128 for detection of partial writes

**Implementation Details:**
- All modifications are staged until commit time
- Atomic commit operations ensure all-or-nothing semantics
- Failed operations trigger automatic rollback with state restoration

### Consistency Implementation
REDB maintains consistency through strict validation and constraint enforcement at the storage layer.

**Consistency Mechanisms:**
- **Checksum Validation**: All data written with XXH3_128 checksums for integrity verification
- **Format Validation**: Strict enforcement of internal data structure invariants
- **Transaction Ordering**: Sequential write application ensures consistent state transitions
- **State Validation**: Comprehensive validation during recovery operations

### Isolation Implementation (MVCC)
REDB implements sophisticated Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) providing serializable isolation.

**MVCC Architecture:**
```rust
// Conceptual MVCC implementation approach
struct MVCCTransaction {
    transaction_id: u64,
    root_snapshot: PageRef,
    read_timestamp: Timestamp,
}
```

**Isolation Features:**
- **Serializable Isolation**: Highest isolation level available in database systems
- **Copy-on-Write B-Trees**: Each transaction operates on consistent snapshots
- **Non-Blocking Reads**: Read operations never block, ensuring high concurrency
- **Page Lifecycle Management**: Sophisticated page freeing with reference counting

**MVCC Implementation Details:**
- Read transactions create private copies of B-tree roots
- Page freeing queued until all referencing transactions complete
- Registration system tracks active transactions to prevent premature page reuse
- Zero-copy reads through memory-mapped access patterns

### Durability Implementation
REDB provides configurable durability with multiple commit strategies optimized for different use cases.

**Commit Strategies:**

1. **Non-Durable Commits**
   - Improved performance without sacrificing atomicity, consistency, or isolation
   - Database remains consistent after crashes but may lose recent non-durable commits
   - Optimal for high-frequency operations where some data loss is acceptable

2. **1-Phase + Checksum Commits**
   - Single fsync operation with monotonically increasing transaction IDs
   - Transaction completeness validated via checksums
   - Balanced approach between performance and durability guarantees

3. **2-Phase Commits**
   - Maximum security against data manipulation
   - Two fsync operations for enhanced durability guarantees
   - Suitable for critical data requiring highest durability levels
