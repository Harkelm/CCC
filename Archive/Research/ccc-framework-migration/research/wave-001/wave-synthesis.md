*Synthesized: 2025-09-23 12:17:29 CST*

## Wave Summary

**Objective**: Establish architectural foundation and core technology decisions for single-user CCC framework migration from Obsidian to Rust-based system.

**Completion Status**: 100% - All three foundation research tasks completed with Extended PRISMA validation

## Completed Tasks Analysis

### **[SEARCH-001]: Hexagonal Architecture Patterns** | **Quality**: B2 | **Status**: Complete
**Key Finding**: Trait-based hexagonal architecture optimal for single-user systems
- **Architecture Pattern**: Domain-first design with trait-based ports and adapters
- **Dependency Injection**: Compile-time DI through generics avoids framework overhead
- **Event System**: Tokio async streams for reactive knowledge management
- **Plugin Strategy**: Compile-time trait composition (avoid dynamic loading complexity)
- **Sources**: 12 high-quality sources (4 A1-A2, 5 B1-B2, 3 B3)

### **[SEARCH-002]: Database Technology Selection** | **Quality**: B2+ | **Status**: Complete
**Key Finding**: REDB recommended over RocksDB (8.25/10 weighted score)
- **Performance**: REDB 2-3x faster for read-heavy workflows (typical CCC usage)
- **API Quality**: Superior Rust ergonomics with type-safe BTreeMap-like interface
- **Memory Efficiency**: Copy-on-write B-trees more efficient for local deployment
- **Use Case Fit**: Read-heavy workflow/prompt management aligns with REDB strengths
- **Decision**: Definitive recommendation for REDB as CCC database foundation

### **[SEARCH-003]: Agent Context Management** | **Quality**: B2+ | **Status**: Complete
**Key Finding**: Hierarchical API design with action-selector patterns for clean context delivery
- **API Structure**: RESTful `/workflows/{id}/phases/{phase}` for clean access patterns
- **Context Isolation**: Action-selector patterns provide security boundaries
- **Memory Architecture**: Hybrid state management with strategic caching layers
- **Error Handling**: Context preservation through snapshots and circuit breakers
- **Single-User Optimization**: Simplified patterns avoiding multi-agent coordination overhead

## Synthesized Foundation Architecture

### **Core Technology Stack**
```
CCC Framework Architecture (Single-User):
├── Architecture: Hexagonal (trait-based ports/adapters)
├── Database: REDB (embedded, type-safe, read-optimized)
├── Context Management: Hierarchical API with action-selectors
├── Event System: Tokio async streams
├── Extensions: Compile-time trait composition
└── Integration: Debian AI system coordination
```

### **Implementation Strategy Convergence**
1. **Database Foundation**: REDB selected for optimal single-user performance
2. **Architecture Foundation**: Trait-based hexagonal for modularity without complexity
3. **Context Foundation**: Hierarchical API design for clean agent instruction delivery
4. **Event Foundation**: Async reactive patterns for knowledge management workflows

## Source Quality Matrix

| Task | Sources | Avg Rating | Quality Distribution | Key Issues |
|------|---------|------------|---------------------|------------|
| SEARCH-001 | 12 | B2 | 4 A-tier, 5 B1-B2, 3 B3 | None identified |
| SEARCH-002 | Multiple | B2+ | Official docs (A1), benchmarks (B1-B2) | None identified |
| SEARCH-003 | 18 | B2+ | 4 A2, 6 B2, 8 B3 | None identified |

**Overall Quality**: B2+ average across all foundation research
**Cross-Validation**: All critical findings independently verified through multiple sources

## Key Integration Points Identified

### **Architecture → Database Integration**
- Trait-based ports align perfectly with REDB's type-safe interface
- Async patterns (Tokio) integrate well with REDB's async API
- Event-driven architecture supports reactive data access patterns

### **Database → Context Management Integration**
- REDB's hierarchical key-value structure supports workflow/phase access patterns
- Type-safe interface enables compile-time validation of context access
- Performance characteristics support real-time agent instruction delivery

### **Foundation → Migration Integration**
- Trait-based architecture enables incremental migration from Obsidian
- REDB provides import/export capabilities for knowledge asset preservation
- Context management API can bridge Obsidian markdown to structured workflows

## Research Gaps Identified

### **Addressed in Foundation Research**
- ✅ Core architecture pattern selection
- ✅ Database technology decision
- ✅ Context management strategy
- ✅ Single-user optimization focus

### **Requiring [WAVE-002] Investigation**
- **Schema Design**: Specific REDB schema for CCC workflows and knowledge structures
- **Component Selection**: Specific Rust libraries for search, documentation, validation
- **Migration Implementation**: Detailed Obsidian→REDB transformation processes
- **Integration Patterns**: Concrete integration with existing Debian AI infrastructure

### **Requiring [WAVE-003] Validation**
- **Alternative Approaches**: Validation of chosen patterns against alternatives
- **Performance Validation**: Real-world integration testing with hardware setup
- **Expert Consensus**: Professional validation of architectural decisions

## Next Wave Preparation

### **[WAVE-002] Context Package**
**Foundation Decisions Confirmed**:
- **Architecture**: Trait-based hexagonal pattern (implement port definitions)
- **Database**: REDB selected (design schema and access patterns)
- **Context Management**: Hierarchical API design (implement workflow access)

**[WAVE-002] Research Focus**:
- **[SEARCH-004]**: REDB schema design for CCC workflows (build on database selection)
- **[SEARCH-005]**: Rust ecosystem components (integrate with architectural patterns)
- **[SEARCH-006]**: Obsidian migration strategy (implement with REDB and trait architecture)

**Critical Dependencies Resolved**:
- Database technology decided → enables schema design research
