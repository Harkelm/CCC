- Security assessments current and independently validated

**Implementation Source Validation**:
- Code examples tested for compilation and basic functionality
- Integration patterns verified through official documentation
- Performance claims cross-validated through multiple independent sources
- Best practices confirmed through community consensus and expert opinion

## Cross-Validation Analysis

### **Multi-Source Verification Results**

**Technology Selection Validation**:
- **REDB Performance**: Validated through official benchmarks [A1], community implementations [B1-B2], independent analysis [B3]
- **Rust Ecosystem Maturity**: Confirmed through Stack Overflow surveys [A2], community adoption [B1], professional usage [B2]
- **Integration Patterns**: Verified through official documentation [A1], professional implementation [B1-B2], community examples [B3]

**Architecture Pattern Validation**:
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Initial validation [B1-B2] challenged by expert opinion [A2] - consistent cross-validation
- **Context Management**: Validated through academic sources [A2], professional patterns [B1], implementation examples [B2]
- **Migration Strategies**: Confirmed through technical analysis [B1-B2] and expert criticism validation [A2]

### **Conflict Resolution Analysis**

**Identified Source Conflicts**:
1. **Architecture Complexity Assessment**:
   - **Supporting Sources** [B1-B2]: Hexagonal architecture provides clear benefits
   - **Expert Challenge** [A2]: Potential overengineering for single-user systems
   - **Resolution**: Expert sources given higher weight due to A2 rating and specific domain expertise

2. **Database Ecosystem Considerations**:
   - **Performance Sources** [A1-B1]: REDB demonstrates superior performance characteristics
   - **Expert Caution** [A2]: SQLite ecosystem maturity should be evaluated
   - **Resolution**: Both perspectives maintained with prototype evaluation recommendation

**Conflict Resolution Protocol**:
- A1-A2 sources given priority for critical decisions
- Expert domain-specific knowledge weighted above general technical sources
- Conflicting evidence documented with recommendation for practical evaluation
