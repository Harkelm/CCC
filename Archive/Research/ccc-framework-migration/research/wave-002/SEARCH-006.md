## Findings & Analysis

### Primary Research Results [VALIDATED]

#### Key Finding 1: Multi-Tool Content Extraction Strategy
**Evidence Rating**: B1 | **Confidence Level**: High

**Finding Description**: Combination of obsidian-export Rust CLI and metadata-extractor plugin provides comprehensive content and metadata extraction from Obsidian vaults.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- **Primary Source**: obsidian-export GitHub repository [A2] - Rust CLI supporting CommonMark conversion with link preservation
- **Cross-Validation**: metadata-extractor plugin [B1] - Exports tags, frontmatter, and graph data not accessible through standard export
- **Quantitative Data**: obsidian-export processes "1000s of files in seconds" with UTF-8 encoding assumptions

**Implications**: Two-tool approach addresses both content structure preservation and metadata extraction requirements for comprehensive migration.

#### Key Finding 2: REDB Integration Architecture Pattern
**Evidence Rating**: A2 | **Confidence Level**: Medium

**Finding Description**: REDB embedded database requires custom migration layer due to key-value storage model incompatibility with standard SQL migration tools.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- **Primary Source**: REDB official documentation [A1] - Key-value store with ACID properties and integrity validation
- **Cross-Validation**: MarkdownDB project [A2] - Demonstrates markdown-to-database conversion patterns using SQLite
- **Quantitative Data**: REDB includes built-in check_integrity() function for automatic corruption detection and repair

**Implications**: Custom migration infrastructure required but REDB provides superior data integrity and performance for CCC framework requirements.

#### Key Finding 3: Incremental Migration Feasibility
**Evidence Rating**: B2 | **Confidence Level**: High

**Finding Description**: Phased migration approach with shadow mode operation enables zero-downtime transition while maintaining workflow continuity.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- **Primary Source**: Data migration best practices [B1] - Trickle migration strategy with source/target parallelism
- **Cross-Validation**: Zero-downtime migration patterns [B3] - Multiple industry examples of phased approaches
- **Quantitative Data**: Phased approaches reduce downtime compared to big-bang migrations and enable validation at each stage

**Implications**: Migration can be performed incrementally without disrupting daily knowledge management workflows.

### Secondary Findings [VALIDATED]

#### Supporting Analysis
- **Contextual Factor 1**: LazyVim git integration provides seamless development environment for Rust-based migration tools
- **Limitation Factor 1**: obsidian-export has lossy conversion limitations for some Obsidian-specific markdown features
- **Future Research Opportunity 1**: Custom REDB schema design for optimal CCC framework integration requires additional investigation

## Migration Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Content Extraction and Preparation [CRITICAL]

#### Content Extraction Pipeline
**📋 Extraction Workflow**:
1. **Obsidian Vault Backup**: Complete vault backup with timestamp verification
2. **metadata-extractor Export**: Extract all metadata, tags, and graph relationships
3. **obsidian-export Conversion**: Convert markdown content with link preservation
4. **Validation and Reconciliation**: Cross-validate extracted content against source vault

#### Data Validation Framework
**📋 Validation Checkpoints**:
- **Content Integrity**: Verify all files extracted with correct encoding
- **Metadata Preservation**: Validate frontmatter, tags, and classification data
- **Link Integrity**: Confirm all internal links properly mapped and preserved
- **Asset Preservation**: Ensure images, attachments, and media files included

### Phase 2: REDB Schema Design and Implementation [TECHNICAL]

#### Schema Architecture
**📋 REDB Schema Components**:
```rust
// Proposed CCC-REDB Schema Structure
Documents {
    id: DocumentId,
    content: String,
    metadata: MetadataMap,
    classification: SecurityLevel,
    created: Timestamp,
    modified: Timestamp,
}
