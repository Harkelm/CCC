## Integration Architecture Recommendations

### Trait-Based Component Integration

```rust
// Core CCC traits for component integration
pub trait SearchEngine {
    fn index_document(&self, doc: &Document) -> Result<DocumentId>;
    fn search(&self, query: &str) -> Result<Vec<SearchResult>>;
}

pub trait Storage {
    fn store<T: Serialize>(&self, key: &str, value: &T) -> Result<()>;
    fn retrieve<T: DeserializeOwned>(&self, key: &str) -> Result<Option<T>>;
}

pub trait DocumentGenerator {
    fn generate(&self, template: &str, context: &impl Serialize) -> Result<String>;
}
```

### Component Bridge Implementation

```rust
// Tantivy-REDB Bridge
pub struct TantivyRedbStorage {
    redb: Arc<Database>,
    tantivy: Arc<Index>,
}

impl SearchEngine for TantivyRedbStorage {
    // Bridge implementation connecting Tantivy search with REDB storage
}
```

### Async Runtime Optimization for Single-User

```rust
// Single-threaded runtime for reduced overhead
#[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]
async fn main() {
    // CCC application entry point
}
```
