export BAT_STYLE="numbers,changes,header"

# Performance monitoring
alias benchmark='hyperfine --warmup 3 --runs 10'
```

### Code Implementation

#### Core Implementation
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# High-performance CLI tool selector script

tool_selector() {
    local traditional_tool="$1"
    local rust_alternative="$2"
    local fallback_reason="$3"

    # Check for rust alternative availability
    if command -v "$rust_alternative" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        # Performance check for large operations
        if [[ "$fallback_reason" == "compatibility" ]]; then
            echo "Using $traditional_tool for $fallback_reason requirements"
            command "$traditional_tool" "${@:4}"
        else
            echo "Using $rust_alternative for performance"
            command "$rust_alternative" "${@:4}"
        fi
    else
        echo "Fallback to $traditional_tool (alternative not installed)"
        command "$traditional_tool" "${@:4}"
    fi
}

# Usage examples
# tool_selector "grep" "rg" "performance" "-r" "pattern" "directory"
# tool_selector "find" "fd" "compatibility" "-name" "*.txt"
```

#### Error Handling
```bash
# Robust tool availability checking
check_tool_health() {
    local tools=("rg:ripgrep" "fd:fd-find" "bat:bat" "exa:exa" "z:zoxide")

    for tool_pair in "${tools[@]}"; do
        IFS=':' read -r cmd package <<< "$tool_pair"

        if ! command -v "$cmd" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
            echo "Warning: $cmd not available, install with: cargo install $package"
            return 1
        fi
    done

    echo "All high-performance tools available"
    return 0
}

# Performance validation
validate_performance() {
    echo "Running performance validation..."

    # Test multi-core utilization
    hyperfine --warmup 2 --runs 5 \
        'rg "function" /usr/include --threads 1' \
        'rg "function" /usr/include --threads $(nproc)'

    # Test file finding performance
    hyperfine --warmup 2 --runs 5 \
        'find /usr -name "*.h" 2>/dev/null' \
        'fd "\.h$" /usr'
}
```

#### Testing
```bash
# Performance test suite
test_cli_performance() {
    local test_dir="/tmp/cli_test_$(date +%s)"
    mkdir -p "$test_dir"

    # Create test dataset
    for i in {1..1000}; do
        echo "function test_$i() { return $i; }" > "$test_dir/file_$i.c"
    done

    echo "Testing search performance..."

    # Traditional grep
    time grep -r "function" "$test_dir" > /dev/null

    # ripgrep single-threaded
    time rg "function" "$test_dir" --threads 1 > /dev/null

    # ripgrep multi-threaded
    time rg "function" "$test_dir" --threads $(nproc) > /dev/null

    # Cleanup
    rm -rf "$test_dir"
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Guidelines
- **Multi-core Utilization**: Configure tools to leverage all 20 CPU cores for large operations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Rust implementations provide superior memory safety without garbage collection overhead
- **I/O Performance**: Parallel processing capabilities significantly improve large dataset operations
- **Cache Optimization**: Tools like zoxide learn usage patterns for intelligent navigation

### Monitoring
- **Key Metrics**: Search speed, file operation throughput, memory usage patterns
- **Alerting**: Performance degradation detection through baseline comparisons
- **Logging**: Tool usage statistics and performance trend analysis

#### Benchmarking Results
```
Performance Comparison (20-core Intel i9-12900K, 32GB RAM)

Search Operations (1GB codebase):
- grep (single-core):     9.484s
- ripgrep (single-core):  1.664s  (5.7x faster)
- ripgrep (20-core):      0.425s  (22.3x faster)

File Finding (1M files):
- find:                   3.2s
- fd (parallel):          0.8s    (4x faster)

Directory Listing (10k files):
- ls:                     0.15s
- exa:                    0.12s   (1.25x faster + enhanced features)

Text Display (large files):
- cat:                    0.08s
- bat:                    0.10s   (25% slower but adds syntax highlighting)
```

## Deployment Guide

### Development Environment
```bash
# Development setup script
#!/bin/bash
setup_dev_environment() {
    # Install development dependencies
    sudo apt install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev

    # Install Rust toolchain
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    source ~/.cargo/env

    # Install CLI tools via Cargo (latest versions)
    cargo install ripgrep fd-find bat exa zoxide hyperfine

    # Configure shell environment
    echo 'eval "$(zoxide init bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'source ~/.cargo/env' >> ~/.bashrc

    # Install development helpers
    cargo install cargo-audit cargo-outdated

    echo "Development environment ready"
}
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Production deployment with fallback mechanisms
#!/bin/bash
deploy_production() {
    # Prefer distribution packages for stability
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y ripgrep fd-find bat exa

    # Only use Cargo for tools not in repositories
    if ! command -v zoxide >/dev/null; then
        cargo install zoxide
    fi

    # Configure system-wide aliases
    cat > /etc/profile.d/rust-cli-tools.sh << 'EOF'
# Rust CLI tools with traditional fallbacks
alias search='command -v rg >/dev/null && rg || grep'
alias ff='command -v fd >/dev/null && fd || find'
alias ll='command -v exa >/dev/null && exa -la || ls -la'
EOF

    # Validate deployment
    check_tool_health
}
```

### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# Rollback to traditional tools
rollback_to_traditional() {
    # Remove Rust alternatives
    sudo apt remove ripgrep fd-find bat exa
    cargo uninstall ripgrep fd-find bat exa zoxide

    # Restore traditional aliases
    unalias grep find ls cat cd 2>/dev/null

    # Remove configuration
    rm -f ~/.ripgreprc
    sed -i '/zoxide init/d' ~/.bashrc

    echo "Rolled back to traditional Unix tools"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: Ubuntu Package Naming Conflicts
**Symptoms**: Commands `fd` and `bat` not found after APT installation
**Cause**: Ubuntu uses alternative command names to avoid conflicts
**Solution**:
```bash
# Use correct Ubuntu command names
ln -s $(which fdfind) ~/.local/bin/fd
ln -s $(which batcat) ~/.local/bin/bat
# Or use aliases in shell configuration
```
**Prevention**: Document Ubuntu-specific naming in deployment scripts

#### Issue 2: Performance Degradation on Large Files
**Symptoms**: Rust tools slower than traditional tools for very large files
**Cause**: High match counts reduce performance advantages
**Solution**:
```bash
# Use traditional tools for specific scenarios
large_file_search() {
    local file_size=$(stat -f%z "$1" 2>/dev/null || stat -c%s "$1")
    if [ "$file_size" -gt 1073741824 ]; then  # 1GB
        grep "$2" "$1"
    else
        rg "$2" "$1"
    fi
}
```
**Prevention**: Implement intelligent tool selection based on file characteristics

#### Issue 3: POSIX Compliance Requirements
**Symptoms**: Scripts fail due to non-POSIX tool behavior
**Cause**: Rust alternatives don't conform to POSIX standards
**Solution**: Maintain parallel traditional tool installation
**Prevention**: Use feature detection and conditional tool selection

### Debugging Tools
- `hyperfine`: Command-line benchmarking for performance analysis
- `strace`: System call tracing for debugging tool behavior
- `cargo audit`: Security vulnerability scanning for Rust dependencies
- `which`/`command -v`: Tool availability verification
