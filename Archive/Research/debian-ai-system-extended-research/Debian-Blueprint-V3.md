# Debian AI System Blueprint v3: Practical Power User Setup
*Streamlined Development Environment for Local AI-Enhanced Coding*

## ðŸŽ¯ Philosophy

**Simple but Fast**: Install the best tools, let them use what they need, no complex orchestration
**User-Focused**: Single power user, not enterprise deployment
**AI-Enhanced**: Local AI for coding assistance without cloud dependencies
**Performance-First**: Use dramatically faster alternatives where they exist

**Target**: RTX 4070 + 20-core CPU + 32GB RAM
**Goal**: Build a blazingly fast AI-enhanced development environment without enterprise overhead

## Foundation Layer: The Essentials

### **System Base**
- [ ] **Debian 12 (Bookworm)** - Stable, well-supported
- [ ] **NVIDIA Driver 570.26+** - RTX 4070 + CUDA 12.6+ support
- [ ] **Essential tools** - curl, wget, git, build-essential, htop

### **Modern Alternatives That Actually Matter**
Based on research showing 10-200x performance improvements:

- [ ] **UV** - Python package management (80-115x faster than pip)
- [ ] **Ruff** - Python linting (70x faster than pylint)
- [ ] **Ripgrep (rg)** - Text search (much faster than grep)
- [ ] **FD** - File finding (faster than find)
- [ ] **Bat** - File viewing with syntax highlighting
- [ ] **Exa/Eza** - Better ls with git integration

---

## AI Layer: Local Intelligence

### **Local AI Models with Ollama**
Simple, no complex allocation schemes:

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Get coding models (adjust size based on your usage)
ollama pull codellama:7b-instruct-q8_0    # Primary coding assistant
ollama pull deepseek-coder:6.7b-instruct  # Alternative for specific tasks
```

**Why this works**: RTX 4070's 12GB VRAM easily handles 7B models while leaving room for everything else. No need to pre-allocate specific amounts.

### **LazyVim AI Integration**
Research shows sub-500ms response times are achievable:

- [ ] **Neovim 0.9+** with LazyVim distribution
- [ ] **blink.cmp** for fast AI completion
- [ ] **Ollama integration** for local model access

Simple config addition to LazyVim for AI completion - no complex orchestration needed.

---

## Development Layer: Speed Where It Matters

### **Languages & Tools**
Based on research findings of dramatic performance improvements:

**Python (Primary)**:
- [ ] **UV** for package management (game-changing speed improvement)
- [ ] **Ruff** for linting/formatting (replaces black, pylint, etc.)
- [ ] **Poetry** for dependency management (when UV isn't enough)

**Rust (Growing)**:
- [ ] **Rust toolchain** - cargo, rustfmt, clippy
- [ ] **cargo-make** for build automation (better than make/invoke)

**Node.js**:
- [ ] **Node.js LTS** with **pnpm** (faster than npm)

**Optional Experimental**:
- [ ] **Odin** - Only if you want to experiment with game dev or performance-critical code

### **Editor Experience**
- [ ] **LazyVim** with AI completion
- [ ] **Language servers** for all your languages
- [ ] **Tree-sitter** for syntax highlighting
- [ ] **Telescope** with ripgrep integration

---

## Container Layer: Better Alternatives

Research shows Podman is 20-50% faster than Docker with less overhead:

- [ ] **Podman** - Rootless, no daemon, GPU passthrough works
- [ ] **nvidia-container-toolkit** - For GPU access in containers

Simple alias for compatibility:
```bash
alias docker=podman
alias docker-compose=podman-compose
```

---

## Terminal Layer: Modern Experience

Research identified several improvements worth making:

- [ ] **Fish shell** - Faster startup, better autocomplete than zsh
- [ ] **Starship prompt** - Fast, informative
- [ ] **Tmux** or **Zellij** - Terminal multiplexing (Zellij has better UX)
- [ ] **Ghostty terminal** (when available) - GPU-accelerated

---

## Optional Enhancements

### **Creative Applications** (If Needed)
- [ ] **Blender** - GPU rendering with RTX 4070
- [ ] **GIMP** - Image editing
- [ ] **OBS Studio** - Screen recording

### **System Monitoring** (Lightweight)
- [ ] **btop++** - System monitor with GPU support
- [ ] **nvtop** - NVIDIA GPU monitoring
- [ ] **duf** - Disk usage (better than du)

### **Security** (Practical)
- [ ] **ufw** - Simple firewall
- [ ] **fail2ban** - Basic intrusion prevention

---

## Installation Strategy

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)**
Get the basics working:
1. System base + NVIDIA drivers
2. UV + Ruff for Python (immediate speed boost)
3. Basic CLI tools (ripgrep, fd, bat, etc.)

### **Phase 2: AI Integration (Week 2)**
Add the AI layer:
1. Ollama + local models
2. LazyVim with AI completion
3. Test and tune for your workflow

### **Phase 3: Environment Polish (Week 3+)**
Make it yours:
1. Modern terminal setup
2. Container tools if needed
3. Additional languages as required

## Performance Expectations

Based on research validation:

**Immediate Improvements**:
- **70x faster** Python linting with Ruff vs pylint
- **80-115x faster** Python package installation with UV
- **40+ tokens/second** AI code completion

**System Resource Usage**:
- **GPU**: AI models use what they need, game/creative apps get the rest
- **CPU**: Modern tools automatically use available cores efficiently
- **RAM**: 32GB handles everything with room for aggressive caching
- **Storage**: NVMe speed utilized for model loading and compilation

**No Complex Allocation**: Let the OS and tools manage resources dynamically. They're good at it.
