- **Quantitative Analysis**: 7B models achieve "breezing past 40 tokens per second" with GGUF/EXL2 Q8 quantization, 13B models reach ~10 tokens/second with Q4 quantization [B2]

**Implications**: RTX 4070 suitable for production coding assistance with proper model selection and quantization strategy. 7B models provide optimal balance of capability and performance.

#### Key Finding 2: Framework Performance Comparison Results
**Evidence Rating**: B2 | **Confidence Level**: High

**Finding Description**: TensorRT-LLM delivers 29.9% performance improvement over llama.cpp on RTX 4070 laptop GPU, with better memory efficiency despite higher VRAM utilization.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- **Benchmark Data**: TensorRT-LLM achieved 51.57 t/s vs llama.cpp 39.70 t/s on RTX 4070 laptop GPU [B2]
- **Memory Efficiency**: TensorRT-LLM used 76.55% less RAM (1.04GB vs 4.44GB) while using 11.60% more VRAM [B2]
- **Model Size Optimization**: TensorRT-LLM models 25% smaller than GGUF equivalents (3.05GB vs 4.06GB for Mistral 7B) [B2]

**Implications**: TensorRT-LLM provides significant performance and memory efficiency advantages for RTX 4070 deployment, particularly important for concurrent development workloads.

#### Key Finding 3: Optimal Context Window Configuration
**Evidence Rating**: B2 | **Confidence Level**: Medium

**Finding Description**: RTX 4070 12GB VRAM supports 4K-8K context windows for 7B models, with 16K-32K possible for some configurations. Context length significantly impacts VRAM usage through KV cache scaling.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- **Context Recommendations**: 7B models support 16K-32K contexts optimally, 13-14B models limited to 4K-8K contexts [B2]
- **Memory Scaling**: KV cache grows linearly with context length, creating primary VRAM constraint [B2]
- **Performance Trade-offs**: VRAM overflow to CPU causes "dramatic performance drop" from "dozens of tokens per second to a crawl" [B2]
