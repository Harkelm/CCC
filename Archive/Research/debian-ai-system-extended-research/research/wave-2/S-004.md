    raylib.CloseWindow()
}
```

#### Foreign Function Interface Example
```odin
// Integration with existing C libraries
package gpu_compute

foreign import cuda "system:cuda"
foreign import cublas "system:cublas"

@(default_calling_convention="c")
foreign cuda {
    cudaMalloc :: proc(devPtr: ^rawptr, size: uint) -> i32 ---
    cudaMemcpy :: proc(dst: rawptr, src: rawptr, count: uint, kind: i32) -> i32 ---
    cudaFree :: proc(devPtr: rawptr) -> i32 ---
}

// High-performance GPU computation setup
setup_gpu_compute :: proc(data_size: uint) -> (gpu_ptr: rawptr, success: bool) {
    result := cudaMalloc(&gpu_ptr, data_size)
    return gpu_ptr, result == 0
}
```
