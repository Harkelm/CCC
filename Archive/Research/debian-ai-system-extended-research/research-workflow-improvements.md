# Research Workflow Error Tracking & Improvement Recommendations
*Documentation of research impediments and workflow optimization opportunities*

## Purpose
This document tracks errors, problems, and hiccups that impede the research workflow to enable continuous improvement of the /deep-research command and research methodologies. All observations are documented for future workflow enhancements and process optimization.

## Potential Research Workflow Impediments <WORKFLOW>

### **High-Risk Impediments**

<IR-001>

#### **[IR-001]: Emerging Technology Source Scarcity** [COMPLETE]
**Problem**: Several research areas (R-001, R-004, R-008) focus on cutting-edge or niche technologies where high-quality sources may be limited
**Potential Impact**:
- Difficulty achieving B3+ Admiralty Code ratings for emerging technologies
- Extended research time due to source validation challenges
- Potential gaps in cross-validation for critical findings

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Lower source quality thresholds to B3 minimum (instead of B2+ preferred) for emerging technologies
- Emphasize expert opinion and early adopter documentation when authoritative sources unavailable
- Document source limitations explicitly in research findings
- Consider extended research timelines for technology areas with limited documentation

**Workflow Improvements**:
- Pre-research source availability assessment for emerging technologies
- Alternative research strategies for limited-documentation technologies
- Expert consultation escalation procedures for source-scarce domains

</IR-001>

#### **[IR-002]: Local AI Model Benchmarking Complexity** [IN-PROGRESS]
**Problem**: R-001 requires hardware-specific benchmarking that may be difficult to validate without direct hardware access
**Potential Impact**:
- Performance claims may lack empirical validation
- Difficulty distinguishing theoretical vs. real-world performance
- Extended research time for hardware-specific optimization

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Focus on vendor-provided benchmarks and community validation data
- Document performance claims with appropriate confidence intervals
- Emphasize comparative analysis rather than absolute performance metrics
- Leverage existing RTX 4070 benchmarking studies where available

**Workflow Improvements**:
- Hardware-specific research methodology guidelines
- Community benchmark validation protocols
- Performance claim confidence level standards
