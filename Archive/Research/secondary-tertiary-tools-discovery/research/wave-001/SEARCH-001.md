**Implications**: Modern terminal workflows should prioritize libvips for performance-critical image processing while maintaining ImageMagick compatibility.

#### Key Finding 5: Clipboard Integration Standardization
**Evidence Rating**: B2 | **Confidence Level**: High

**Finding Description**: Clipboard integration follows clear protocol divisions with wl-clipboard for Wayland and xclip/xsel for X11, requiring conditional logic for cross-platform compatibility.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- **Primary Source**: wl-clipboard manual pages and tmux integration documentation [B2]
- **Implementation Examples**: Conditional tmux configuration for protocol detection [B3]
- **Compatibility Notes**: wl-clipboard-x11 provides X11 compatibility layer [B3]

**Protocol-Specific Tools**:

**Wayland (wl-clipboard)**:
- `wl-copy`: Copy content to Wayland clipboard
- `wl-paste`: Retrieve content from Wayland clipboard
- Protocol-specific implementation required

**X11 (xclip/xsel)**:
- `xclip`: Lightweight command-line clipboard interface
- `xsel`: X selection manipulation program
- Mature and stable implementations

**Cross-Platform Integration**:
```bash
# Tmux conditional configuration
# Wayland
set -s copy-command "wl-copy -p"
bind-key p run "wl-paste -n | tmux load-buffer - ; tmux paste-buffer"

# X11
set -s copy-command "xsel -s"
bind-key p run "xclip -out -selection secondary | tmux load-buffer - ; tmux paste-buffer"
```

**Implications**: Robust terminal workflows require protocol detection and conditional tool selection for clipboard integration.
