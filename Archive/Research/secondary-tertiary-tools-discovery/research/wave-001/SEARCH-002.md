## Integration Guidelines for tmux + LazyVim Workflows

### Recommended Terminal Media Stack
1. **Video Playback**: `mpv --hwdec=auto` with custom keybindings
2. **Music Management**: `cmus` for library + `beets` for organization
3. **Media Conversion**: `ffmpeg` with custom shell functions/aliases
4. **Streaming**: `yt-dlp` with aria2 for performance
5. **Subtitle Handling**: `ffmpeg` for conversions

### Configuration Optimization

#### mpv Configuration (`~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf`)
```
hwdec=auto
vo=gpu
profile=gpu-hq
cache=yes
demuxer-max-bytes=50MiB
```

#### cmus Optimization
```bash
# Add to shell profile
alias cmus-import='cmus-remote -C "add ~/Music"'
alias cmus-update='cmus-remote -C "update-cache"'
```

#### yt-dlp Performance Configuration
```bash
# High-performance download alias
alias ytdl='yt-dlp --external-downloader aria2c --external-downloader-args "-x 16 -s 16"'
```

## Performance & Resource Usage Assessment

### CPU/Memory Efficiency Rankings
1. **cmus**: Excellent (15MB footprint, fast startup)
2. **mpv**: Excellent (hardware-accelerated, optimized shaders)
3. **termusic**: Good (Rust performance benefits)
4. **musikcube**: Good (efficient C++ implementation)
5. **ncmpcpp**: Variable (depends on MPD configuration)

### Disk I/O Optimization
- **beets**: Minimal during playback, intensive during library organization
- **FFmpeg**: High during conversion, negligible during playback
- **yt-dlp**: Network-dependent, optimized with aria2

## Research Gaps & Limitations

### Areas Requiring Further Investigation
- Real-time streaming protocol support (RTMP, WebRTC) in terminal players
- Integration with cloud storage services for media libraries
- Advanced audio processing plugins for audiophile use cases
- Cross-platform synchronization tools for playlists and metadata

### Known Limitations
- VLC hardware acceleration regression requiring version 4 for resolution
- Some subtitle tools lack active maintenance and comprehensive format support
- Terminal media players may have limited support for proprietary formats (DRM-protected content)

## Recommendations

### Primary Recommendations for CCC Framework Integration
1. **Adopt mpv as primary video player** with hardware acceleration enabled by default
2. **Implement cmus + beets combination** for music library management and organization
3. **Standardize on yt-dlp** for streaming media acquisition and archival
4. **Utilize FFmpeg** as universal media processing backbone
5. **Create wrapper scripts** for common media operations within tmux workflows

### Integration Priority
1. **High Priority**: mpv, cmus, yt-dlp, FFmpeg (core media handling)
2. **Medium Priority**: beets (library organization), termusic (modern alternative)
3. **Low Priority**: Subtitle-specific tools (FFmpeg handles most use cases)

### Performance Optimization Strategies
- Enable hardware acceleration by default where available
- Implement intelligent caching strategies for large media libraries
- Utilize parallel processing capabilities in modern tools
- Configure optimal memory/CPU usage profiles for terminal environments
