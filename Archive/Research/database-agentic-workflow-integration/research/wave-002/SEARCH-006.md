}

// Agent workflow coordination through events
pub struct WorkflowOrchestrator {
    event_bus: Box<dyn EventBus>,
    state_repository: Box<dyn DataRepository>,
}
```

**Benefits for Agentic Systems**:

### Testing Strategy for Hexagonal Architecture

**Source Authority**: Software Testing Community & Technical Blogs | **Rating**: B3
**Publication**: 2024-2025 | **Version**: Current practices
**Evidence Quality**: B3-2 (Fairly reliable with probably true information)

**Key Information**:
- Mock implementations of ports enable comprehensive unit testing without external dependencies
- Each port requires minimum two adapters: mock for testing and real for production
- Layered testing strategy: unit tests (domain logic), integration tests (adapters), end-to-end tests (full system)
- Contract testing validates adapter behavior consistency with port specifications

**Testing Implementation Pattern**:
```rust
// Mock adapter for testing
pub struct MockDataRepository {
    stored_states: Arc<Mutex<HashMap<AgentId, AgentState>>>,
}

#[async_trait]
impl DataRepository for MockDataRepository {
    async fn store_agent_state(&self, state: AgentState) -> Result<(), RepositoryError> {
        // In-memory simulation for testing
    }
}

// Test business logic in isolation
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_workflow_execution_logic() {
    let mock_repo = MockDataRepository::new();
    let workflow = AgentWorkflow::new(Box::new(mock_repo));
    // Test domain logic without database dependencies
}
```

**Reliability Assessment**:

}

impl ServiceContainer {

## Research Gaps & Limitations

### Identified Knowledge Gaps
- Limited examples of hexagonal architecture specifically applied to multi-agent systems
- Minimal documentation on performance optimization for database-agnostic abstractions
- Insufficient coverage of real-time event processing requirements for agentic workflows

### Research Limitations
- Most examples focus on web services rather than agentic systems
- Testing strategies assume traditional application patterns rather than autonomous agent behaviors
- Migration guidance primarily covers monolith-to-microservice rather than monolith-to-agentic transitions

### Areas Requiring Further Investigation
- Performance benchmarking of database abstraction overhead
- Event latency optimization for real-time agent coordination
- Memory management patterns for long-running agent processes
- Integration testing strategies for CCC framework validation workflows
