## Architectural Integration Analysis

### **Performance Optimization Foundation ([SEARCH-004])**
**Memory and Resource Coordination**:
- **CUDA Memory Management**: RMM unified memory architecture for RTX 4070 12GB VRAM coordination
- **CPU Resource Allocation**: 20-core system with database thread reservation and dynamic scheduling
- **Database Thread Optimization**: 8-10 DuckDB threads (1-4GB each) coordinated with AI model memory usage

**Async Operation Patterns**:
- **Tokio Runtime**: spawn_blocking for CPU-intensive database operations
- **Concurrent Patterns**: tokio::join! for parallel database queries during AI inference
- **Non-blocking Access**: Maintaining AI model performance baselines during database operations

**Connection Pooling Strategy**:
```rust
// SQLite + rusqlite: r2d2/deadpool with Arc<Mutex<T>>
// DuckDB: Async pooling with thread optimization
// SurrealDB: Native multi-writer concurrency
```

**Performance Achievements**:
- **I/O Optimization**: 60x latency reduction through memory-mapped model loading
- **Caching**: 60x database performance improvement with hybrid memory + Redis
- **Resource Efficiency**: 10-20% operational cost reduction through dynamic allocation
