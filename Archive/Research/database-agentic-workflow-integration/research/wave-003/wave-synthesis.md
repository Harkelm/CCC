```

### **Query Optimization Strategy ([SEARCH-008])**
**Database-Specific Optimization**:
```rust
// SQLite Optimization
PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;
PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;
PRAGMA cache_size = 10000;
PRAGMA temp_store = memory;

// DuckDB Parallel Execution (8-10 threads)
SET threads = 8;
SET memory_limit = '4GB';
SET max_memory = '32GB';

// SurrealDB Graph Query Optimization
SELECT * FROM agent_components
WHERE id IN (SELECT VALUE ->component_id FROM component_dependencies);
```

**Performance Architecture**:
- **Async Query Patterns**: Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP) for non-blocking operations
- **Connection Pooling**: Concurrent agentic operations with memory coordination
- **Materialized Views**: Pre-computed component assembly paths for sub-second retrieval
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Performance tracking and automatic optimization triggers

**Hardware Optimization for RTX 4070 + 20-core CPU + 32GB RAM**:
- **Memory Allocation**: 8-10 DuckDB threads (1-4GB each) coordinated with AI model VRAM usage
- **CPU Threading**: Parallel query execution leveraging 20-core architecture
- **CUDA Coordination**: Database caching balanced with AI model memory requirements

### **Component Standardization Framework ([SEARCH-009])**
**Industry Standard Compliance**:
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Dominant standard for AI agent interoperability (2025)
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**: Reliable evolution pathways for component libraries
- **Package URL (PURL)**: Component discovery and intelligent recommendation systems
- **Microservices Architecture**: Proven patterns for behavioral, procedural, persona modules

**Communication Patterns**:
```rust
// Event-Driven Coordination
pub trait AgentEventHandler {
    async fn handle_component_event(&self, event: ComponentEvent) -> Result<(), Error>;
}

// Message Passing Protocol
pub struct ComponentMessage {
    pub source: ComponentId,
    pub target: ComponentId,
    pub payload: MessagePayload,
    pub correlation_id: String,
}

// Error Handling and Recovery
pub enum ComponentError {
    CommunicationFailure { timeout: Duration },
    ValidationFailure { constraint: String },
    DependencyResolutionFailure { cycle: Vec<ComponentId> },
}
```

**Quality Assurance Framework**:
- **Validation Protocols**: FDA, IEEE, and ISO standard compliance for component reliability
- **Testing Integration**: Automated quality assurance with CI/CD integration
- **Ecosystem Governance**: Balanced centralized control with distributed community collaboration
