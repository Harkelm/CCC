## Key Technology Decisions

### Database Strategy: Multi-Database Approach

#### **Primary Database: REDB**
- **Performance**: 7.7x faster writes, 3.8x faster reads vs SQLite
- **Integration**: Pure Rust implementation with zero FFI overhead
- **Use Case**: High-performance metadata operations, content storage, frequent read/write patterns

#### **Secondary Database: SQLite**
- **Purpose**: Complex relational queries, compatibility requirements
- **Optimization**: Connection pooling, prepared statements, WAL mode
- **Use Case**: Analytical queries, legacy integration, development environments

#### **Specialized Analytics: DuckDB** (Optional)
- **Performance**: 3-25x analytical improvements over traditional RDBMS
- **Use Case**: Module-specific analytical workloads, reporting, metrics

### Architecture Recommendation: Layered Architecture (Primary)

**Selection Rationale**:
- **Balanced Complexity**: Medium implementation complexity with high Rust ergonomics
- **Development Velocity**: Rapid development with conventional patterns
- **Performance**: High performance with zero-cost abstractions
- **Team Accessibility**: Gentle learning curve with clear separation of concerns

**Alternative Options Available**:
- **Hexagonal**: Maximum testability for complex domain logic (higher complexity)
- **Modular Monolithic**: Excellent extensibility for multi-team development (future evolution)

## Complete Technology Stack

### Core Dependencies
```toml
[dependencies]
axum = "0.7"                    # HTTP framework (90% Actix performance, better ergonomics)
redb = "2.0"                    # Primary database (high-performance key-value)
rusqlite = "0.30"               # Secondary database (relational queries)
tantivy = "0.22"                # Embedded search (~2x Lucene speed)
askama = "0.12"                 # Templates (10x performance via compile-time)
figment = "0.10"                # Configuration (hierarchical multi-environment)
tokio = "1.0"                   # Async runtime
serde = "1.0"                   # Serialization
thiserror = "1.0"               # Error handling
anyhow = "1.0"                  # Application errors
```

### Performance Characteristics
- **REDB Integration**: Direct key-value operations with 7.7x write performance advantage
- **SQLite Optimization**: Connection pooling provides 30-70% improvement for relational queries
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Architecture patterns compile to optimal assembly without overhead
- **Search Performance**: Tantivy provides ~2x Lucene speed for embedded search operations

## Implementation Architecture

### Layered Architecture Pattern (Recommended)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              HTTP Layer (Axum)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│             Service Layer               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│            Repository Layer             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Database Layer                  │
│  ┌─────────────┬──────────┬───────────┐ │
│  │    REDB     │  SQLite  │  Tantivy  │ │
│  │ (Primary)   │ (Queries)│ (Search)  │ │
│  └─────────────┴──────────┴───────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Benefits**:
- **Clear Separation**: Well-defined boundaries between HTTP, business logic, and data access
- **Database Flexibility**: Repository pattern abstracts database technology choices
- **Performance Optimization**: Connection pooling, caching, and prepared statements
- **Testing Support**: Layer isolation enables comprehensive unit and integration testing
