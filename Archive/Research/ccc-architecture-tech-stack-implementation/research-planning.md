# Research Planning: CCC Framework Architecture & Database Technology Implementation
*Created: 2025-09-23 14:22:33 CST*

## Research Objectives

**Primary Goal**: Design comprehensive technical blueprints for CCC framework implementation through systematic analysis of database technologies (REDB, SQLite, RocksDB, DuckDB) and architectural patterns (hexagonal, layered, modular) with concrete implementation examples.

**Technical Focus**: Actionable implementation guidance, comparative analysis with decision-making criteria, and practical development patterns rather than theoretical frameworks.

**Scope Boundaries**: New system implementation (no migration), manageable complexity (no over-engineering), multiple environment compatibility (no hardware pre-allocation).

**Success Criteria**: Complete technical blueprint for CCC framework implementation with validated technology selections and architectural patterns ready for development.
