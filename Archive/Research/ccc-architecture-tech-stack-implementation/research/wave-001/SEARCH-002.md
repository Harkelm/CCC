## Findings & Analysis

### Primary Research Results [VALIDATED]

#### Key Finding 1: Performance Architecture Fundamentals
**Evidence Rating**: A1 | **Confidence Level**: High

**Finding Description**: RocksDB and DuckDB employ fundamentally different architectures optimized for distinct workload patterns - RocksDB uses LSM-tree architecture for write optimization, while DuckDB uses columnar-vectorized architecture for analytical query performance.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- **Primary Source**: RocksDB official documentation [A1] - LSM-tree write amplification of 20-30x with optimization techniques
- **Cross-Validation**: DuckDB official documentation [A1] - Columnar vectorized execution with 3-25x performance improvements over 3 years
- **Quantitative Data**: RocksDB write amplification reduction >10% through compaction optimization; DuckDB analytical query improvements of 4x for joins, 25x for window functions

**Implications**: Database selection must align with primary workload characteristics - transactional vs analytical processing requirements.

#### Key Finding 2: Rust Ecosystem Maturity and Quality
**Evidence Rating**: A2 | **Confidence Level**: High

**Finding Description**: Both databases offer mature, actively maintained Rust bindings with comprehensive feature coverage and strong community support in 2024.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- **Primary Source**: rust-rocksdb GitHub repository [A2] - Active maintenance with RocksDB v10.2.1 integration, MSRV policy, comprehensive features
- **Cross-Validation**: duckdb-rs GitHub repository [A2] - Version 1.4.0 with modern Rust ecosystem integration, Apache Arrow support
- **Quantitative Data**: rust-rocksdb offers jemalloc optimization, multi-threading support, and LTO capabilities; duckdb-rs provides Arrow integration, serde support, and extension capabilities

**Implications**: Rust integration quality is comparable for both databases, with ecosystem choice driven by functional requirements rather than binding quality.

#### Key Finding 3: Embedding and Deployment Characteristics
**Evidence Rating**: B2 | **Confidence Level**: Medium-High

**Finding Description**: Both databases excel as embedded solutions but serve different deployment patterns - RocksDB for in-process key-value storage with fine-tuned control, DuckDB for in-process analytical processing with minimal overhead.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- **Primary Source**: Official documentation analysis [A1] - RocksDB eliminates network latency with embedded design, DuckDB provides "SQLite for analytics" with no external dependencies
- **Cross-Validation**: Industry analysis [B2] - Both databases offer significant performance advantages through embedded deployment patterns
- **Quantitative Data**: DuckDB compilation to single amalgamation file, RocksDB configurable memory and disk usage with fine-grained tuning

**Implications**: Embedded deployment suitability depends on use case - RocksDB for performance-critical storage layers, DuckDB for analytical processing within applications.

### Secondary Findings [VALIDATED]

#### Supporting Analysis
- **Contextual Factor 1**: Performance characteristics are heavily hardware-dependent, requiring specific configuration tuning for optimal results
