## Critical Insights for Architecture Research

### Database Abstraction Requirements
- **Multi-database strategy** recommended for CCC framework
- **Workload-specific selection**: Different databases excel in different scenarios
- **Future flexibility**: Database abstraction layer essential for technology evolution

### Performance Considerations
- **Write-heavy operations**: REDB significantly outperforms SQLite with sqlx
- **Analytical workloads**: DuckDB provides substantial performance advantages
- **Deployment simplicity**: SQLite offers zero-configuration benefits

### Rust Ecosystem Integration
- **REDB**: Native Rust with compile-time type safety
- **SQLite**: Mature bindings but runtime validation required
- **DuckDB**: Growing Rust ecosystem with modern integration patterns
- **RocksDB**: Production-ready but requires performance tuning expertise

## Research Gaps Identified

### Hybrid Architecture Patterns
- Limited research on multi-database integration patterns
- Need for database abstraction layer design patterns
- Cross-database transaction and consistency patterns

### CCC-Specific Performance Analysis
- Framework-specific workload benchmarking required
- Real-world performance validation with CCC data patterns
- Scaling characteristics for knowledge management workloads

## Next Wave Recommendations

### [WAVE-002] Architecture Implementation Focus
1. **Hexagonal Architecture ([SEARCH-004])**: Emphasize database abstraction through ports and adapters
2. **Layered Architecture ([SEARCH-005])**: Focus on clean separation between data access and domain layers
3. **Modular Architecture ([SEARCH-006])**: Investigate module-based database selection strategies

### Context for Architecture Research
- **Primary Database**: Use REDB for architecture examples (performance leader)
- **Secondary Integration**: Include SQLite patterns for compatibility
- **Abstraction Patterns**: Emphasize database-agnostic design approaches
- **Performance Considerations**: Integrate Wave 1 performance findings into architecture decisions
