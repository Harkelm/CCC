## Key Integration Findings

### Component Selection Synthesis
**HTTP Framework**: Axum emerges as optimal choice
- 90% of Actix-web performance with superior developer ergonomics
- Excellent integration with all three architectural patterns
- Strong async/await ecosystem compatibility

**Search Engine Strategy**: Dual approach recommended
- **Tantivy**: Embedded high-performance operations (~2x Lucene speed)
- **Meilisearch**: API services and complex query capabilities
- Architecture-agnostic integration patterns available

**Template System**: Askama provides clear advantages
- 10x performance improvement through compile-time optimization
- Type-safe template compilation with Rust integration
- Compatible across all architectural patterns

**Configuration Management**: Figment for hierarchical configuration
- Superior multi-environment deployment support
- Clean integration with modular architecture patterns
- Flexible source prioritization (files, environment, CLI)

### Schema Design Patterns Synthesis

#### **Database-Specific Optimization**
- **REDB**: Hierarchical key design with B-tree optimization for content storage
- **SQLite**: Relational metadata schemas with optimized tagging systems
- **DuckDB**: Columnar analytical patterns for reporting and metrics
- **RocksDB**: LSM-tree patterns for audit trails and version control

#### **Architecture Integration Strategies**
- **Hexagonal**: Repository interface patterns with database abstraction layers
- **Layered**: Clean data access layer separation with transaction coordination
- **Modular**: Database-per-module strategies with service isolation

#### **Performance-Optimized Patterns**
- Hierarchical data modeling optimized for read/write patterns per database
- Search integration strategies balancing performance and functionality
- Schema evolution patterns with backward compatibility across architectures

### Performance Optimization Synthesis

#### **Zero-Cost Architecture Abstractions**
- Rust's compile-time optimization eliminates architecture vs performance trade-offs
- Hexagonal, layered, and modular patterns achieve identical runtime performance
- Iterator abstractions compile to optimal assembly without overhead

#### **Database Integration Performance**
- **REDB Integration**: 7.7x write advantage most pronounced in direct access patterns
- **Connection Pooling**: 30-70% improvement in layered architectures
- **Event-Driven Patterns**: Modular architectures excel with async event handling

#### **Developer Experience Optimization**
- Enhanced debugging with tokio-console and comprehensive tracing
- Production-ready containerization with security enhancements
- Architecture-specific testing strategies and mock implementations

## Cross-Wave Integration Summary

### Database → Architecture → Components → Schema Flow

#### **Foundation Decisions (Wave 1)**
- REDB primary for high-performance operations
- SQLite secondary for relational queries and compatibility
- Multi-database strategy enables specialized optimizations

#### **Architecture Implementation (Wave 2)**
- Hexagonal: Maximum testability with complex implementation
- Layered: Balanced complexity with excellent Rust ergonomics
- Modular: Extensible design with clear evolution path

#### **Integration Optimization (Wave 3)**
- Component selection supports all architectural choices
- Schema patterns optimized for each database technology
- Performance strategies tailored to architecture and database combinations

## Final Technology Stack Recommendations

### **Core Technology Stack**
```rust
// HTTP Framework
axum = "0.7"

// Database Integration
redb = "2.0"           // Primary high-performance storage
rusqlite = "0.30"      // Secondary relational queries
duckdb = "0.9"         // Analytics and reporting (optional)

// Search Integration
tantivy = "0.22"       // Embedded search
meilisearch-sdk = "0.24" // API search (optional)

// Templates & Serialization
askama = "0.12"        // Compile-time templates
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }

// CLI & Configuration
clap = { version = "4.0", features = ["derive"] }
figment = { version = "0.10", features = ["toml", "json", "env"] }

// Async Runtime
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }

// Error Handling
thiserror = "1.0"
anyhow = "1.0"
```

### **Architecture-Specific Optimizations**

#### **Hexagonal Architecture**
- Repository traits with `Arc<dyn Trait>` dependency injection
- Async trait implementations with `#[async_trait]`
- Mock testing with Mockall for comprehensive unit testing

#### **Layered Architecture**
- Connection pooling with `r2d2` or `deadpool`
- Prepared statement caching for performance optimization
- Clear service/repository/domain layer separation

#### **Modular Monolithic**
- Cargo workspace structure for compile-time modularity
- Event-driven communication with `tokio::sync` channels
- Feature flags for module activation and configuration
