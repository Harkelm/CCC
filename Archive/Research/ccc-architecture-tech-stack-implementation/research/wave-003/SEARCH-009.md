#### Key Finding 1: Zero-Cost Abstractions Enable Architecture Performance
**Evidence Rating**: A1 | **Confidence Level**: High

**Finding Description**: Rust's zero-cost abstractions eliminate the traditional trade-off between clean architectural patterns and runtime performance. Hexagonal architecture, layered patterns, and modular designs can be implemented without performance penalties through compile-time optimization.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- **Primary Source**: Rust Official Documentation [A1] - "You don't pay for what you don't use" principle with compile-time elimination
- **Cross-Validation**: Performance benchmarks showing identical assembly output between high-level and manual implementations
- **Quantitative Data**: Iterator abstractions compile to identical performance as manual loops with LLVM optimization

**Implications**: Architecture choice can prioritize maintainability and developer experience without sacrificing performance, enabling complex designs with production-ready efficiency.

#### Key Finding 2: Database Integration Performance Varies Significantly by Architecture
**Evidence Rating**: B1 | **Confidence Level**: Medium

**Finding Description**: Database performance optimization strategies vary dramatically between architectural patterns, with layered architectures benefiting most from connection pooling while modular architectures excel with event-driven async patterns.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- **Primary Source**: SQLx and async database performance analysis [B2] - Connection pooling reduces overhead by 30-70%
- **Cross-Validation**: Multiple database client implementations showing architecture-specific optimization benefits
- **Quantitative Data**: REDB 7.7x write performance advantage most pronounced in direct access patterns (hexagonal/modular)

**Implications**: Architecture selection should consider database access patterns and performance requirements, with different optimization strategies optimal for each approach.
