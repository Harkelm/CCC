## Wave 2 Summary

### Completed Tasks
- **[SEARCH-004]**: Hexagonal Architecture Implementation | **Quality**: B3+ sources | **Status**: Complete
- **[SEARCH-005]**: Layered Architecture Implementation | **Quality**: A1-B3 sources | **Status**: Complete
- **[SEARCH-006]**: Modular Monolithic Architecture | **Quality**: A1-A2 sources | **Status**: Complete

## Key Architecture Findings

### Hexagonal Architecture Implementation
**Maturity Assessment**: Production-ready patterns available in Rust ecosystem
- **Database Integration**: REDB primary with `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` for async handling
- **Repository Pattern**: Trait-based abstraction with `Arc<dyn Trait>` dependency injection
- **Testing Strategy**: Mockall for unit testing, testcontainers for integration
- **Async Patterns**: `#[async_trait]` implementations with zero-cost abstractions

**Complexity Trade-off**: Higher initial complexity but excellent testability and maintainability

### Layered Architecture Implementation
**Maturity Assessment**: Well-established patterns with modern Rust optimizations
- **Simplified Approach**: Cleaner than hexagonal architecture with better Rust ergonomics
- **Database Strategy**: REDB for performance + SQLite for relational with trait abstractions
- **Error Handling**: `thiserror` for libraries, `anyhow` for applications
- **Performance**: Connection pooling, prepared statement caching, async wrappers

**Complexity Trade-off**: Lower complexity with good separation of concerns

### Modular Monolithic Architecture
**Maturity Assessment**: Emerging pattern with strong Rust language support
- **Compile-time Modularity**: Feature flags and Cargo workspaces for module organization
- **Database Per Module**: REDB for transactional, DuckDB for analytical workloads
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Type-safe message passing between modules
- **Evolution Path**: Clear migration strategy to microservices

**Complexity Trade-off**: Moderate complexity with excellent extensibility

## Strategic Recommendations

### Architecture Selection Criteria

#### **Choose Hexagonal Architecture If:**
- Maximum testability required
- Complex domain logic with multiple external integrations
- Team experienced with DDD and port-adapter patterns
- Long-term maintainability prioritized over initial velocity

#### **Choose Layered Architecture If:**
- Rapid development velocity required
- Team prefers conventional patterns
- Balanced complexity and maintainability needed
- Clear separation of concerns with minimal overhead

#### **Choose Modular Monolithic If:**
- Future extensibility and evolution critical
- Multiple teams will work on different modules
- Plugin/extension system required
- Migration to microservices anticipated

### Database Integration Synthesis

#### **Cross-Architecture Patterns**
- **REDB Primary**: All architectures benefit from REDB's performance for metadata operations
- **Repository Abstraction**: Trait-based patterns work effectively across all architectures
- **Async Handling**: Common patterns for bridging sync databases with async applications
- **Testing**: Mock implementations critical for all architectural approaches

#### **Architecture-Specific Optimizations**
- **Hexagonal**: Database as external adapter with port interfaces
- **Layered**: Data access layer with repository implementations
- **Modular**: Database selection per module with shared connection management

## Research Gaps Identified

### Integration Patterns
- Component selection guidance for different architectural choices
- Schema design optimization for each architectural pattern
- Performance tuning specific to architecture and database combinations

### Implementation Details
- Production deployment patterns for each architecture
- Monitoring and observability implementations
- Configuration management across different architectural approaches

## Next Wave Recommendations

### [WAVE-003] Integration & Implementation Focus
1. **Component Selection ([SEARCH-007])**: Rust ecosystem components optimized for each architecture
2. **Schema Design ([SEARCH-008])**: Database schema patterns specific to architectural choices
3. **Performance Optimization ([SEARCH-009])**: Architecture-specific performance and developer experience

### Context for Integration Research
- **Architecture Foundation**: All three patterns provide solid implementation blueprints
- **Database Integration**: Common patterns identified with architecture-specific optimizations
- **Component Requirements**: Different architectures may benefit from different component choices
- **Schema Strategies**: Database schema design should align with architectural patterns

## Quality Flags
✅ All searches meet minimum quality thresholds (B3+)
✅ No unresolved architectural conflicts
✅ Implementation blueprints complete for all patterns
✅ Extended validation completed for complex patterns

## Wave Completion Status
**[WAVE-002]**: COMPLETE - Architecture pattern research provides comprehensive implementation blueprints ready for component integration and schema design
