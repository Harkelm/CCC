## Strategy Overview

This template provides systematic search patterns optimized for academic and peer-reviewed sources. Designed for research tasks requiring high-credibility evidence with strong theoretical foundations and empirical validation.

**Target Source Types:**
- Peer-reviewed academic papers
- University research publications
- Academic conference proceedings
- Research institution publications
- Scholarly reviews and meta-analyses

**Expected Admiralty Code Ratings:** A1-A2 (with B1-B2 for emerging academic work)

```

#### **Google Scholar Academic Search**
```
"{research_topic}" site:scholar.google.com
"{research_topic} systematic review" site:scholar.google.com
"{research_topic} meta-analysis" site:scholar.google.com
author:"{known_expert}" "{research_topic}"
```

#### **Research Institution Sources**
```
"{research_topic}" site:*.edu
"{research_topic}" site:*.edu filetype:pdf

## Advanced Academic Search Techniques

### **Temporal Academic Research**
```
"{research_topic}" after:2023
"{research_topic}" "2024" OR "2025"
"{research_topic}" "recent advances"
"{research_topic}" "state of the art" 2024
"{research_topic}" "current research" 2024
```

### **Methodology-Focused Search**
```
"{research_topic}" "methodology"
"{research_topic}" "experimental design"
"{research_topic}" "case study"
"{research_topic}" "qualitative analysis"
"{research_topic}" "quantitative analysis"
```

### **Academic Authority Search**
```
"{research_topic}" "professor" OR "PhD" OR "researcher"
"{research_topic}" "university" OR "institute" OR "laboratory"
"{research_topic}" "principal investigator"
"{research_topic}" "research group"
```

## Source Quality Validation for Academic Research

### **Academic Source Credibility Assessment**

**A1 Rating Indicators:**
- Peer-reviewed journals with high impact factor
- Papers from top-tier academic conferences (IEEE, ACM, etc.)
- Research from renowned universities and research institutions
- Work by recognized experts with established academic credentials

**A2 Rating Indicators:**
- Peer-reviewed journals with moderate impact factor
- Academic conference papers with review process
- Thesis and dissertation work from accredited institutions
- Research reports from established academic institutions

**B1 Rating Indicators:**
- Working papers from academic institutions
- Academic preprints with institutional affiliation
- Research center publications with peer review
- Academic workshop papers with review process

### **Academic Validation Checklist**
- [ ] **Peer Review Status**: Confirm peer review process and journal/conference quality
- [ ] **Author Credentials**: Verify academic affiliations and expertise
- [ ] **Citation Quality**: Check citation count and citing paper quality
- [ ] **Institutional Affiliation**: Confirm academic or research institution backing
- [ ] **Methodology Rigor**: Assess experimental design and statistical validity
- [ ] **Replication Status**: Check if findings have been independently validated
