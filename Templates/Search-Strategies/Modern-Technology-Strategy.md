## Source Quality Assessment for Modern Technologies

### **Modern Technology Credibility Framework**

**B1 Rating Indicators (Usually Reliable, Confirmed):**
- Detailed implementation reports from verified practitioners
- Technology analysis from established industry publications
- Comprehensive reviews from recognized technology experts
- Well-documented case studies with specific metrics and outcomes

**B2 Rating Indicators (Usually Reliable, Probably True):**
- Quality blog posts from verified developers with implementation experience
- Community discussions with multiple participant validation
- Technology comparisons from established development platforms
- Early adopter reports with detailed technical implementation

**B3 Rating Indicators (Fairly Reliable, Possibly True):**
