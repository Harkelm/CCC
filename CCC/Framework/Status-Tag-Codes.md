## Usage Guidelines

### üìã **Status Assignment Rules**
- **Completion Definition**: Mark [COMPLETED] ONLY when 100% of requested work is finished with verifiable evidence
- **Evidence Requirements**: All status claims must include specific evidence (file paths, commands, verification proof)
- **No Assumptions**: Treat all operations unverified until explicitly confirmed
- **Real-time Updates**: Update status immediately upon task state changes

### üö® **Critical Status Protocols**
- **[ERROR]**: Immediate escalation required, document failure details
- **[BLOCKED]**: Cannot proceed, requires explicit user authorization
- **[WARNING]**: Continue with caution, document risk assessment
- **[DEGRADED]**: Functional but compromised, monitor for escalation

### ‚úÖ **Validation Standards**
- **[VALIDATED]**: Requires systematic validation using appropriate PRISMA tier (10/15/27-item)
- **[FIELD_TESTED]**: Operational validation in real-world conditions
- **[EXPERIMENTAL]**: Development status, not approved for production use
- **[UNVERIFIED]**: Pending validation, use with caution
