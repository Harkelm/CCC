## Risk Assessment Framework

### 🎯 **Risk Identification Categories**
- **Information Security**: Unauthorized access, data exposure, malicious content
- **Quality Degradation**: Inaccurate information, outdated content, bias propagation
- **Operational Continuity**: System failures, data loss, process disruption
- **Compliance Violations**: Legal/regulatory breaches, policy non-compliance

### 📊 **Impact & Likelihood Scale**
**Impact Levels:**
- **Critical (4)**: Severe consequences, major disruption, safety risks
- **High (3)**: Significant impact, substantial disruption, compliance issues
- **Medium (2)**: Moderate impact, manageable disruption, process delays
- **Low (1)**: Minor impact, minimal disruption, easily recoverable

**Likelihood Levels:**
- **Very Likely (4)**: >75% probability, frequent occurrence expected
- **Likely (3)**: 50-75% probability, regular occurrence possible
- **Possible (2)**: 25-50% probability, occasional occurrence
- **Unlikely (1)**: <25% probability, rare occurrence

## Risk Assessment Triggers

### 🚨 **Mandatory Assessment Required**
- [ ] **New Technology Integration**: AI tools, external systems, plugins
- [ ] **Process Changes**: Workflow modifications affecting multiple users
- [ ] **Data Sensitivity Changes**: Classification level modifications
- [ ] **Third-Party Dependencies**: External service integrations
- [ ] **Security Incidents**: Breaches, vulnerabilities, or failures detected
- [ ] **Compliance Requirements**: New regulatory obligations

### ⚠️ **Recommended Assessment**
- [ ] **Content Volume Scaling**: Repository growth beyond normal capacity
- [ ] **User Base Expansion**: Access requests beyond original scope
- [ ] **Cross-Domain Integration**: Multi-framework coordination projects
- [ ] **Performance Issues**: System efficiency below baseline metrics

## Rapid Risk Evaluation

### ⚡ **5-Minute Risk Check**
1. **What could go wrong?** (Failure modes identification)
2. **How likely is it?** (Probability assessment 1-4)
3. **What would be the impact?** (Consequence evaluation 1-4)
4. **Can we prevent/mitigate it?** (Control options available)
5. **Is the residual risk acceptable?** (Risk tolerance check)

### 🎯 **Risk Score Matrix**
```
Risk Score = Impact × Likelihood
16-12: Critical Risk (Immediate action required)
11-8:  High Risk (Prompt action needed)
7-4:   Medium Risk (Monitor and plan)
3-1:   Low Risk (Accept or monitor)
```

## Risk Treatment Options

### 🛡️ **Treatment Strategies**
- **🚫 Avoidance**: Eliminate risk through process changes or alternative approaches
- **🔧 Mitigation**: Reduce likelihood or impact through preventive/protective controls
- **🤝 Transfer**: Share risk through contracts, insurance, or outsourcing
- **✅ Acceptance**: Accept risk within documented tolerance levels

### 📋 **Control Types**
- **Preventive**: Stop risks from occurring (access controls, validation)
- **Detective**: Identify when risks occur (monitoring, alerts)
- **Corrective**: Respond when risks materialize (incident response, recovery)
- **Compensating**: Alternative controls when primary controls fail

## Emergency Decision Framework

### 🚨 **Critical Risk Response (IMMEDIATE)**
**Score 16-12 or Safety/Security Issues:**
1. **STOP** current activities immediately
2. **ASSESS** immediate safety and security implications
3. **IMPLEMENT** emergency controls if safe to do so
4. **ESCALATE** to appropriate authority
5. **DOCUMENT** incident and response actions

### ⚠️ **High Risk Response (URGENT)**
**Score 11-8:**
1. **PAUSE** and evaluate situation
2. **IMPLEMENT** available risk controls
3. **SEEK** guidance if needed
4. **PROCEED** with enhanced monitoring
5. **REVIEW** effectiveness regularly

## Risk Decision Matrix

| Risk Score | Response Time | Authority Level | Documentation |
|------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| 16-12 (Critical) | Immediate | Management | Full incident report |
| 11-8 (High) | Within hours | Supervisor | Risk assessment |
| 7-4 (Medium) | Within days | User | Risk notation |
| 3-1 (Low) | Routine | Agent | Risk acknowledgment |

## Context-Specific Considerations

### 🔍 **Content Development Risks**
- **Source Credibility**: Using unreliable sources (B3+ required)
- **Bias Propagation**: Amplifying existing biases in content
- **Information Currency**: Using outdated information in dynamic fields
- **Scope Creep**: Expanding beyond authorized boundaries

### 🤖 **AI Operation Risks**
- **Over-reliance**: Bypassing human validation checkpoints
- **Hallucination**: Generating plausible but incorrect information
- **Context Loss**: Misunderstanding user intent or requirements
- **Automation Failure**: System errors affecting automated processes
