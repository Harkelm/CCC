## Validation Tier Selection

### 🎯 **Tier Assignment**
- **Essential (10-item)**: Standard content, routine operations, <20% overhead
- **Extended (15-item)**: Important content, cross-domain integration, 20-35% overhead
- **Comprehensive (27-item)**: Critical content, research/safety applications, 35-45% overhead

### 📊 **Evidence Standards**
- **B3 Minimum**: All standard operations (Usually reliable + Possibly true)
- **B2+ Preferred**: Important decisions (Usually reliable + Probably true)
- **A2+ Required**: Critical applications (Completely reliable + Probably true)
- **A1 Target**: Framework documentation (Completely reliable + Confirmed)

## Rapid Validation Triggers

### ⚡ **Quick Assessment Questions**
1. **Content Impact**: Could errors cause significant harm or loss?
2. **Stakeholder Reach**: Will this affect multiple users or systems?
3. **Evidence Quality**: Are sources credible and independently verifiable?
4. **Time Sensitivity**: Is there adequate time for proper validation?
5. **Risk Level**: What are the consequences of being wrong?

### 🚨 **Automatic Tier Escalation**
- **Safety implications** → Comprehensive tier required
- **Legal/regulatory content** → Extended minimum
- **Multi-stakeholder impact** → Extended minimum
- **Novel or experimental content** → Extended minimum

## Evidence Rating System

### 🏅 **Source Reliability (Letter)**
- **A**: Official documentation, peer-reviewed research
- **B**: Industry experts, established documentation
- **C**: Quality community sources, verified content
- **D**: Marketing materials, unverified sources

### 📊 **Information Credibility (Number)**
- **1**: Confirmed by multiple independent sources
- **2**: Probably true with expert support
- **3**: Possibly true with some supporting evidence
- **4**: Doubtful with conflicting evidence

### ⚖️ **Quality Thresholds**
- **B3**: Minimum for standard operations
- **A2**: Required for critical decisions
- **A1**: Target for all framework content
