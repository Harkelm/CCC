*Critical Authorization Controls for AI Assistant Decision Making*

## Authorization Checkpoint Protocol

### üìã Before ANY Action - Mandatory Validation:
- [ ] **Explicit Instruction Verification**: "Does this action exceed explicit user instruction?"
- [ ] **Authorization Confirmation**: "Did user explicitly authorize this specific action?"
- [ ] **Assumption Detection**: "Am I inferring authorization not explicitly provided?"
- [ ] **Scope Boundary Validation**: "Is this action within documented instruction boundaries?"

---

## Core Boundary Enforcement

### üéØ Scope Management Framework
**üìã Boundary Enforcement Standards:**
- [ ] Initial scope documentation with exact user requirements quoted
- [ ] No work outside documented scope without explicit authorization
- [ ] User must explicitly authorize any scope expansion
- [ ] Never assume authorization from related or implied requests
- [ ] Verify any inferred user intent with explicit authorization request

### Scope Expansion Prevention
**üìã Cognitive Override Prevention:**
- [ ] Helpfulness impulse cannot override explicit instruction compliance
- [ ] Creating guides/plans does not imply implementation authorization
- [ ] Never add tasks not explicitly requested without authorization
- [ ] No file changes beyond explicit user instruction
- [ ] No directory structures without explicit authorization

## Research Scope Overlap Detection Protocol

### üîç Research Overlap Detection Checklist
**üìã Pre-Research Validation for Research Domain Tasks:**
- [ ] **Previous Research Identification**: Search Research domain for related or overlapping research topics
- [ ] **Scope Boundary Documentation**: Clearly define what distinguishes current research from previous work
- [ ] **Extension vs. Duplication Assessment**: Identify whether task extends previous research or duplicates existing findings
- [ ] **Reference Integration Requirements**: Document how current research builds upon or references previous findings
- [ ] **Gap Analysis Documentation**: Explicitly identify what gaps current research addresses that previous research did not

### üîó Previous Research Integration Framework
**Research Continuity Standards:**
- **Previous Work Citation**: All related previous research must be explicitly referenced and built upon
- **Scope Differentiation**: Clear documentation of how current research differs from or extends previous work
- **Methodology Consistency**: Maintain consistency with established research methodologies where applicable
- **Evidence Building**: Systematic building upon previous research findings rather than starting from zero

**Research Overlap Categories:**
- **Extension Research**: Explicitly builds upon previous research with defined scope expansion
- **Update Research**: Updates previous research with new information or changed circumstances
- **Comparative Research**: Compares new approaches with previously researched solutions
- **Validation Research**: Validates or challenges conclusions from previous research with new evidence
