## Security Classification Framework

### üè∑Ô∏è **Information Classification**
- **üåê PUBLIC**: Open access, no restrictions, public distribution approved
- **üè¢ INTERNAL**: Organization access only, basic access controls required
- **üîí CONFIDENTIAL**: Sensitive information, explicit authorization required
- **üîê SECRET**: Highly sensitive, strict need-to-know access only

### üìä **Classification Criteria**
- **Data Sensitivity**: Personal, financial, proprietary, or strategic information
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Legal compliance obligations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- **Business Impact**: Potential harm from unauthorized disclosure
- **Stakeholder Reach**: Number of people/systems affected

---

## Essential Security Controls

### üîç **Asset & Data Management**
- **Asset Inventory**: Know what systems, data, and resources exist
- **Data Classification**: Apply appropriate sensitivity labels
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access restrictions
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive information (AES-256 standard)

### üõ°Ô∏è **Access Controls**
- **Authentication**: Verify identity before granting access
- **Authorization**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Need-to-Know**: Limit access to those requiring information
- **Time-Based Restrictions**: Implement access time limits where appropriate

### üìä **Monitoring & Detection**
- **Activity Logging**: Record access and modification activities
- **Anomaly Detection**: Monitor for unusual access patterns
- **Incident Response**: Define procedures for security events
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodic access and security assessments

---

## Security Decision Framework

### ‚ö° **Quick Security Assessment**
1. **What information am I handling?** (Classification check)
2. **Who should have access?** (Need-to-know principle)
3. **How sensitive is this data?** (Impact of exposure)
4. **What controls are needed?** (Appropriate protections)
5. **How will I monitor access?** (Detection capabilities)

### üö® **Security Escalation Triggers**
- **Unauthorized Access**: Suspicious access attempts or patterns
- **Data Exposure**: Potential breach or unauthorized disclosure
- **System Compromise**: Malware, corruption, or unauthorized changes
- **Compliance Violation**: Regulatory requirement breach
- **Policy Deviation**: Departure from established security procedures

---

## Secure Operations Protocol

### üìÅ **File & Data Handling**
- **Encryption Requirements**: AES-256 for CONFIDENTIAL and above
- **Access Logging**: Record all access to sensitive information
- **Backup Protection**: Secure backup storage with access controls
- **Disposal Procedures**: Secure deletion of sensitive information

### üîó **External Communications**
- **Channel Security**: Use encrypted communications for sensitive data
- **Source Verification**: Validate identity of external parties
- **Data Transmission**: Apply appropriate protections during transfer
- **Third-Party Vetting**: Assess security posture of external services

---

## Incident Response Framework

### üö® **Immediate Response (Security Incident)**
1. **CONTAIN**: Isolate affected systems/data if safe to do so
2. **ASSESS**: Evaluate scope and potential impact
3. **NOTIFY**: Alert appropriate security personnel/management
4. **PRESERVE**: Maintain evidence for investigation
5. **RECOVER**: Implement recovery procedures when authorized

### üìã **Incident Classification**
- **Critical**: Active breach, data exposure, system compromise
- **High**: Attempted breach, policy violation, suspicious activity
- **Medium**: Security weakness, configuration issue, minor violation
- **Low**: Security awareness, training opportunity, minor deviation

## Security Control Matrix

| Classification | Encryption | Access Control | Monitoring | Backup |
|---------------|------------|----------------|------------|---------|
| **PUBLIC** | Optional | Basic | Standard | Standard |
| **INTERNAL** | Recommended | RBAC | Enhanced | Secure |
| **CONFIDENTIAL** | Required (AES-256) | Need-to-know | Real-time | Encrypted |
| **SECRET** | Required (AES-256) | Strict controls | Continuous | Encrypted + Offline |

---

## Common Security Considerations

### üîí **Data at Rest**
- **File Encryption**: Sensitive files encrypted on storage
- **Database Security**: Encrypted databases with access controls
- **Backup Protection**: Secure backup storage and recovery
- **Archive Security**: Long-term storage protection

### üåê **Data in Transit**
- **Communication Encryption**: TLS/SSL for data transmission
- **API Security**: Secure API endpoints and authentication
- **Network Protection**: VPN or secure networks for sensitive traffic
- **Email Security**: Encrypted email for confidential communications

### üë§ **User Access**
- **Account Management**: Proper user provisioning and deprovisioning
- **Privilege Management**: Regular review of user permissions
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling and timeout
- **Authentication**: Strong authentication mechanisms
