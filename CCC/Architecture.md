# CCC Framework Architecture
*Systematic Knowledge Management Through Evidence-Based Standards*

---

## Framework Overview

The **Context Command Center (CCC)** framework integrates proven methodologies from **ISO 31000** (Risk Management), **Enhanced PRISMA 2020** (Systematic Validation), and **CIS Controls v8 IG1** (Cybersecurity) to create a comprehensive knowledge management system optimized for Obsidian.

### Core Design Principles

- **Bias Mitigation**: Assumption challenge methodology with expert review

#### ü§ñ **AI-Human Collaboration**
- **4.8x Productivity**: AI-assisted workflows with human validation checkpoints
- **49% Error Reduction**: Systematic quality gates and automated validation
- **Human Authority**: AI assists, humans decide and validate
- **Quality Preservation**: Automated quality without sacrificing standards

#### üõ°Ô∏è **Balanced Security**
- **CIS Controls IG1**: 56 foundational safeguards adapted for knowledge management
- **Information Classification**: PUBLIC/INTERNAL/CONFIDENTIAL/SECRET levels
- **Access Governance**: Role-based access with need-to-know principles
- **Usability Balance**: Security controls that enhance rather than hinder workflow

#### üìä **Systematic Risk Management**
- **ISO 31000 Integration**: Three-component risk framework (Principles/Framework/Process)
- **Proactive Risk Assessment**: Early identification and mitigation strategies
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regular risk landscape assessment and adaptation

## Framework Integration

### üî¨ **Enhanced PRISMA 2020 Implementation**

The framework extends standard PRISMA methodology with enhanced validation protocols:

#### **Validation Tiers**
- **Essential (10-item)**: All vault content - basic systematic quality
- **Extended (15-item)**: Important content - enhanced validation with bias assessment
- **Comprehensive (27-item)**: Critical content - full PRISMA compliance with expert review

#### **Evidence Standards**
- **Minimum Threshold**: B3 Admiralty Code rating for all sources
- **Preferred Standard**: A1-A2 ratings for critical findings
- **Source Diversity**: Multiple source types and perspectives required
- **Preservation**: Complete provenance tracking with archive locations

See: **[[CCC/Standards/Enhanced-PRISMA]]** for complete validation checklists.

### üéØ **ISO 31000 Risk Integration**

Risk management embedded throughout knowledge lifecycle:

#### **Risk Categories**
- **Information Security**: Unauthorized access, data breaches, malicious content
- **Quality Degradation**: Inaccurate information, outdated content, bias propagation
- **Operational Continuity**: System failures, data loss, process disruption
- **Compliance Violations**: Regulatory breaches, policy non-compliance

#### **Risk Treatment**
- **Avoidance**: Eliminate risk through process changes
- **Mitigation**: Reduce likelihood/impact through controls
- **Transfer**: Share risk through contracts or insurance
- **Acceptance**: Accept risk within tolerance levels

See: **[[CCC/Standards/ISO-31000-Risk-Management]]** for complete framework implementation.

### üõ°Ô∏è **CIS Controls v8 IG1 Security**

Security controls adapted specifically for knowledge management:

#### **Implementation Phases**
1. **Foundation (0-3 months)**: Asset inventory, access controls, backup procedures
2. **Enhancement (3-6 months)**: Advanced controls, monitoring, incident response
3. **Optimization (6-12 months)**: Security automation, threat detection, compliance

#### **Knowledge-Specific Controls**
- **Asset Management**: Comprehensive content and system inventory
- **Access Control**: RBAC with content classification integration
- **Data Protection**: Encryption, backup, and recovery for knowledge assets
- **Monitoring**: Security event detection and response for knowledge systems

See: **[[CCC/Security/CIS-Controls-Implementation]]** for detailed security roadmap.

## Content Organization Philosophy

### üìö **Domain-Based Structure**

Content organized by knowledge domain rather than artificial hierarchies:

- **[[Research/]]** - Academic research, systematic analysis, literature reviews
- **[[Technical/]]** - Software development, system architecture, technical guides
- **[[Survival/]]** - Wilderness skills, emergency preparedness, practical knowledge
- **[[Literature/]]** - Literary analysis, creative works, cultural knowledge
- **[[Projects/]]** - Active initiatives, planning, and project management

### üîó **Relationship-Centric Linking**

Obsidian's graph capabilities enhanced through systematic linking:

- **Bidirectional Links**: `[[Target Document]]` for two-way connections
- **Section Links**: `[[Document#Section]]` for precise references
- **Transclusion**: `![[Document]]` for content embedding
- **Aliasing**: `[[Long Name|Short]]` for readable references
- **Contextual Tagging**: Domain, quality, and framework tags for discovery

### üè∑Ô∏è **Systematic Tagging**

Consistent tagging strategy for enhanced discoverability:

```
#domain/research #quality/validated #framework/prisma #type/literature-review
```

- **Domain Tags**: `#research`, `#technical`, `#survival`, `#literature`
- **Quality Tags**: `#validated`, `#draft`, `#needs-review`, `#expert-reviewed`
- **Framework Tags**: `#prisma`, `#iso31000`, `#cis-controls`, `#ccc`
- **Type Tags**: `#guide`, `#checklist`, `#template`, `#reference`
